C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Sam Siatta was deep in a tequila haze, so staggeringly drunk that he would later say he retained no memory of the crime he was beginning to commit.",1,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"It was a few minutes after 2 a.m. on April 13, 2014. Siatta had just forced his way into a single-story home in Normal, Ill., a college town on the prairie about 130 miles southwest of Chicago. A Marine Corps veteran of the war in Afghanistan, he was a 24-year-old freshman studying on the G.I. Bill at the university nearby, Illinois State. He had a record of valor in infantry combat and no criminal past. He also had no clear reason to have entered someone else’s home, no motive that prosecutors would be able to point to at trial — no intention to rob, no indication that he knew or had even seen before any of the three young female teaching students who lived inside, or the boyfriends who were with two of them.",2,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Two of the women and one of the men had awakened minutes earlier when they thought they heard someone opening and closing the front door. It had been an unnerving sensation, the feeling that an intruder had stepped into the home. They tried to settle themselves and return to bed, only to be jolted by a house-shaking bang — the sound of Siatta hitting the back door with such force that he splintered the jamb.",3,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The door swung open into a dining area. Siatta strode into the unfamiliar space, just around the block from the similarly sized home where he rented a room. A little more than six feet tall and weighing about 175 pounds, he was a thoroughly trained veteran of a small-unit ground war and heavily tattooed, with red tally marks on his sternum indicating seven Taliban kills from 2009 and 2010. His former company commander would later tell a trial judge that of the 388 troops he led in Afghanistan, Siatta was the man the militants feared most.",4,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,The women cowered behind a flimsy bedroom door. One of them dialed 911. Another clutched a stubby kitchen knife.,5,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Since leaving the corps in 2012, Siatta had been unable to switch off the habits of war. He was hypervigilant and struggled to relax. He watched people, sizing them up and scanning for threats. In the varying situations of everyday life, he constantly repositioned himself so no one got behind him. Much of this was appropriate for combat patrols. Some of it drew from his training. All of it was mentally and emotionally exhausting, unsuited for a peaceful life. Going to a restaurant, moving through knots of people at a party, visiting the mall, finding a seat in a classroom relative to other people and windows and doors — each was a challenge requiring effort and will.",6,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had been in a deepening funk for months. For more than four years he had been stalked by memories of civilians his platoon had killed, people whose lives had abruptly ended for a reason as unforgiving as it was simple — being in the wrong place when the shooting began. The Department of Veterans Affairs would later say he suffered from depression, alcohol dependency and PTSD. But until this moment, he had adapted with behaviors allowing him to pass as less troubled than he was. He avoided crowds. He drank prodigious amounts of alcohol to dim his heightened alertness and to muffle his sorrows. He socialized rarely, often only with his mother or brother.",7,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The dining area Siatta had entered gave way to a little kitchen, which opened into a small living room. In that adjoining room, perhaps 25 feet from Siatta, stood one of the boyfriends, another young former Marine. In any number of situations, the two men might have become friends. But they had served in different places and jobs in the corps, and the man in the living room had no idea he had anything in common with the man in the kitchen. He positioned himself between his girlfriend and the shattered door.",8,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He was shorter than Siatta but more muscular, with a build hinting at years of weight training and competitive wrestling. He was also sober. He looked across the kitchen at the broken door. The deadbolt was still extended. Whoever had forced the door was strong. He heard movement around the corner, a rustling from the back of the house. He held a steak knife with a serrated eight-inch blade, the weapon he managed to muster in the seconds he had to think.",9,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta stepped into his line of sight. He was walking toward the living room, deeper into the house.",10,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Only one man knows exactly what happened next. Knife in hand, he identified himself as a former Marine and demanded that Siatta get out.",11,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“You don’t belong here,” he said. “You need to leave.”",12,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta kept walking, the man said, and lifted a frying pan off the stove as he passed by. “You have been bad,” he said, raising the pan by its handle. “And this will do.”",13,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Whatever options had existed narrowed to one. The fight began.,14,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The first time I saw Sam Siatta was in April 2016 at the Shawnee Correctional Center, a medium-security state penitentiary in southern Illinois. He was brought by the guards to a dreary conference room, away for the moment from a cellblock for serious offenders. Before he arrived, a correctional officer asked me and two members of the law firm representing Siatta whether we wanted a guard stationed nearby, in case the inmate acted up.",15,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta walked in wearing blue prison garb. He had the light feet and muscular shoulders of a young fighter. His short sleeves offered glimpses of grim tattoos — a skull resting on an hourglass on his right forearm, among others — common to many grunts. He looked tough. He also looked deflated. He came off as nervous, scared and almost painfully polite, a man overwhelmed by his circumstances.",16,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Richard R. Winter, the attorney who days before had filed an appeal of Siatta’s conviction, asked how he was doing. Any pretense of Siatta as a threat to visitors fell away. He was not doing well. Shawnee, he said, was run by gangs, which he had to take care not to cross. Two cellmates had been Latin Kings, and another was a sex offender who had almost drawn Siatta into a fight over a petty cellblock theft. The aging penitentiary in Pontiac, where he was held while awaiting a court hearing, was worse. There the inmates shouted and wailed through the night, he said, and the place was thick with rodents.",17,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta seemed distraught. He wanted to go home. Did Winter have any news, he wanted to know, about his appeal? Winter gently said it would take time, perhaps a few months before they could expect a hearing.",18,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I had heard of Siatta in February, when T.G. Taylor, a recently retired Army officer, contacted me about a Marine infantry vet who had forced his way into a house in his neighborhood and been stabbed repeatedly by another former Marine. After a helicopter flight to a trauma center, the infantry vet — Siatta — was charged with home invasion, found guilty at trial and sentenced to prison. Taylor had taken a job at Holland & Knight, the firm handling the appeal, which was brought on the grounds that Siatta did not intend to commit the crime because he was almost catatonically intoxicated at the time. Siatta’s case, Taylor said, was about PTSD, a subject he and I had discussed over the years as we tried to help friends struggling with life after war. I was interested but cautious. I served in the Marine infantry in the 1980s and 1990s and knew what everyone who has moved past the slogans knows: That a small fraction of Marines are trouble — problem children, in the gentlest construction of the corps’ otherwise profane slang. Some of these Marines turn criminal and deserve every bit of punishment they get. I told Taylor that I would have to review the case carefully before considering coverage.",19,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By chance, I knew Maj. Scott A. Cuomo, who commanded Siatta’s rifle company in Afghanistan. Cuomo is driven and serious. He had led the school that trains all Marine infantry lieutenants, a post reserved for established stars in the grunt officer corps. I called him with two questions: Was Siatta a problem child? If not, what was going on? Cuomo said Siatta was a solid Marine in combat — a gifted marksman, trusted by his peers, invaluable in firefights and deserving of gratitude, not incarceration. He said he was perplexed by everything he heard out of Illinois.",20,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Reading the case file raised more questions. The prosecutors had taken a hard stance against Siatta, first with charges and in plea negotiations and later in a deposition and in court, where a prosecutor belittled the idea that the accused might have been drunk as a coping mechanism for post-combat illness. Not everyone in the courtroom seemed to concur. At the end, when Siatta’s life had finally tanked, the trial judge all but apologized for sentencing him to prison.",21,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I agreed to meet Siatta in Shawnee. Over a few hours of conversation, he toggled between being marginally expressive and almost poetic. At this late date he had developed a cleareyed view of what ailed him. He described his anxiety and drinking as conditions that grew almost imperceptibly, finally overtaking him in 2014. Until then the symptoms had been easy for him to play down, even if others were concerned. “You don’t notice when you grow half an inch, because you see yourself every day,” he said. “But if you see your loved ones, they say, ‘Oh, you’ve gotten tall.’?”",22,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Once he relaxed, Siatta talked of the killing he had done in Afghanistan — hesitantly at first, then thoroughly — replaying the cool mechanics of precision rifle fire, describing fatal mistakes, tracing where his mind traveled after. His war had been darker than his new lawyer and family knew, more brutal than he expressed in court. It was too late to expect anything to come of it. More than five years remained on his sentence, and Siatta was unlikely to receive help from Illinois’s overburdened correctional system in that time, not even counseling or medication. His fate would depend on a long-shot appeal, which focused on a narrow and not firmly established matter of law. In the waste and shame of a respected vet being warehoused in a penitentiary for a crime he could not recall was part of the foot soldiers’ experience of the Afghan war, including the return to a country content to thank them without understanding them, or why they sometimes stand apart.",23,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Lance Corporal Samuel J. Siatta arrived in Afghanistan in October 2009, one of thousands of Marines who cycled through the effort to defeat the Taliban in Helmand Province, the corps’ ambitious piece of President Obama’s first-term reboot of the Afghan war. He was a rifleman in Fox Company, Second Battalion, Second Marines, a member of First Squad, Third Platoon.",24,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"As he stepped off the aircraft at Camp Leatherneck, a base on the steppe that served as a hub for Marine operations, he was an almost timeless character, a young Marine from the prairie who might have fit into the long lines of riflemen volunteering for his service’s previous wartime campaigns. An adopted son in a Roman Catholic family in Illinois, he was handed to the couple who raised him on the Fourth of July in 1989, when he was 3 days old. His mother’s eldest brother fought as a Marine in Vietnam, and his maternal grandfather was a Marine in World War II. By the time he was in the fourth grade, he was telling grown-ups that he intended to be a Marine.",25,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"His father fell ill with cancer and died when Siatta was 12. Siatta had always been a quiet child and was more so after. A sixth-grade classmate, Ashley Volk, found him approachable and kind. The two dated that year. “He was my first kiss on the cheek,” she said. Volk made a condolence card for their class to sign and puzzled over how he contained his grief. “Sam never cried in front of us,” she said. “It always made us scared for him, because we didn’t know how he was dealing with it inside.”",26,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By eighth grade, Siatta had started lifting weights and hanging out at the gym. Volk worked out as an excuse to be near him. The war in Iraq was raging. The Pentagon’s early success in Afghanistan was unraveling. Anyone could see there was much more fighting ahead, and against foes whose harassing and often dark tactics, emphasizing ambushes, improvised bombs and suicide attacks, were exacting a bloody toll. Siatta let it be known that he still intended to enlist.",27,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta and Volk were an off-again, on-again couple in high school, years during which she tried to talk him out of becoming a Marine. He gave her nicknames, including “pretty lady” and “gypsy,” and resisted her efforts to dissuade him. As a senior he was old enough to sign on the line. Volk pleaded with him again. His decision was firm. He had an urge for action and a sense of duty, and seemed not to care how hard or risky it would be. “It wasn’t about enjoying it,” he told me. “It was about the idea that our Constitution isn’t a bunch of toilet paper, like most of our generation thinks it is.” He enlisted while still in school and requested a place in the infantry, the corps’ toughest job.",28,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"With four years signed away, Siatta began seeing less of Volk, thinking that it would be unfair to leave her waiting while he was gone to war. He departed for boot camp in San Diego on the day he graduated, in May 2008. Volk remembers feeling scared. But she had no argument left to make. “He did it for our country,” she said. “That’s an old soul.”",29,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At boot camp Siatta followed the familiar arc of transformation from civilian to Marine, although as weeks passed he displayed a skill that set him apart: He was an exceptional shot. The Marine Corps is built around its rifles. It expects every member to master what it considers the basic tool of modern war, via thorough training and annual requalification on shooting out to 500 yards. Siatta outshot almost everyone around him. This was not readily explicable. Siatta was raised in a household without firearms and was neither a hunter nor a weapons buff. He had never fired a rifle before.",30,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Instructors in the corps often say that recruits with no weapons experience can become accomplished shots because they have no bad habits to unlearn. Siatta offers this as the explanation for his own superior skill. But when he talks of how he shot, it is also clear that when he looked down the barrel of a rifle he was capable of extreme patience and calm. Even in firefights he could sweep away distraction and focus on the habits that make precision marksmanship possible.",31,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In late 2008, after completing boot camp and an infantry course in which he demonstrated a knack for mixed martial arts and a high pain tolerance to go with his fine motor skills, Siatta checked into his battalion at Camp Lejeune, N.C. In many ways, two of his supervisors said, he was not a model Marine. He wore his uniform sloppily, could be inattentive in garrison and did not show the enthusiasm and initiative of some of his peers. He was pegged as “a field Marine,” a grunt suited for battle but not for the corps’ broader insistence on perfection. “Sometimes we’d say that if Siatta did not shoot as well as he did, we wouldn’t know what to do with him,” said his former squad leader, Sgt. Joseph M. Perez. Siatta accepts this reputation easily and said he chafed at the spit-shine requirements of Marine Corps base life. “They’d say, ‘Your boots are dirty,’?” he told me. “And I’d be like: ‘Of course they are dirty. I’m a fucking rifleman. I joined to do a dirty job.’?” All agree that his skill with a rifle assured his place. As his platoon readied for combat, its commander, Second Lt. Tyler P. Kurtz, selected him for a particularly difficult role: designated marksman.",32,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The D.M., as troops call this position, was a recent adjustment to the corps’ small-unit organization, a role between that of regular riflemen and snipers. It was made necessary, in the corps’ view, by the arid environments of Afghanistan and Iraq, where a dearth of vegetation often meant that gunfights occurred at long ranges, and conventional units needed Marines with skills and equipment to hit targets outside the ready range of standard M4s or M16s. Rare is the Marine who does not wish to shoot better; a culture that celebrates riflery bestows credibility and respect on those who shoot best. Siatta’s selection was an honor, the more so because he was otherwise untested. Kurtz, now a captain who commands a Marine infantry company, said he chose Siatta nonetheless because he exuded maturity when behind a rifle. “He was a natural,” he said.",33,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s selection brought pressures he had not contemplated before. In Afghanistan he would be called on to do the shooting that would make gunfights stop. Through the lens of a telescopic sight, he would also be expected to watch over and protect his platoon, which meant eyeing civilians through cross hairs, one after another, and looking for indicators — a partly hidden weapon, the remote detonator of a bomb — that might give him a military justification to kill. This would require a constant commitment to discernment and a disciplined sense of restraint, balanced with a willingness to take others’ lives, sometimes in the intimate fashion that can come with an eight-power scope. Even the nickname for the role, Guardian Angel, was freighted with a presumption of unerring perfection and righteous power.",34,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had shot only paper targets. He wondered whether he was good enough. What would happen to his friends, he asked himself, if he choked?",35,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The prewar preparations of Second Battalion, Second Marines left little time for rest. Siatta lived in Fox Company’s barracks, where underage drinking was forbidden and policed by noncommissioned officers. He was too young to purchase alcohol legally or enter bars and did not show much interest in alcohol in any event. His fellow Marines recall him hanging back, unlike some of the louder personalities. “He was very quiet, very internal, one of the guys who didn’t say much,” Perez said. “When he spoke, it was pretty comical, because it was like, ‘Whoa, where did that come from?’?”",36,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In late October 2009, the battalion landed in Afghanistan and quickly moved into the rural badlands. In keeping with the corps’ latest way of waging war, its Marines were to spend a seven-month tour characterized by an unrelenting pace of small foot patrols. At Camp Leatherneck, Fox Company was given its first mission: to set up in patrol bases near the village of Lakari, drive off the Taliban and help the Afghan government extend security and services into the area.",37,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"It was an ambitious order. Helmand Province, Afghanistan’s largest, had had a light Western military presence since 2001. Much of it had taken the form of British units in fortified outposts with limited influence over territory around them. After a bloody campaign in Iraq’s Anbar Province, the Marine Corps shifted attention to Helmand, turning the province into the corps’ own corner of Afghanistan. The villages around Lakari, nestled amid irrigated cropland along the winding Helmand River about 90 miles from Pakistan, formed a Taliban and drug-runners’ stronghold. Other Marines raided Lakari in the summer, but they left, and the area remained beyond the Afghan government’s reach. The local bazaar, on dusty land east of the river, was a no-go zone — full-on enemy turf.",38,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 1, the company’s First and Third Platoons arrived at Patrol Base Lakari, a crude outpost built weeks before. Little more than tents surrounded by a 13-foot-high dirt berm, it had the hastily conceived and temporary feel of much of the Marine involvement in Afghanistan. It was reached through a gate and watched over by four raised bunkers where Marines rotated turns on post, one in each bunker by day, two by night.",39,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"From behind sandbags and bulletproof glass, the Marines looked upon a desolate vista and could feel menace awaiting them. Like the bazaar, about a mile to the south, the patrol base was situated just outside the irrigated cropland, at the edge of the steppe. Vegetation and a maze of dried mud walls lay to the west and southwest. The year’s poppy crop had been harvested. A stubble of corn stalks dotted the landscape. The farmers between the base and the bazaar were presumed to be spotters who watched the Americans’ routine and signaled their movements to the Taliban. No patrol could leave the base without being seen before it reached the fields.",40,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Whenever Marines ventured into the neighboring patchwork of farmland, canals and homes, they were entering a network of interconnected traps. Small slits had been cut in the mud walls — Marines called them “murder holes” — from which the Taliban could fire. Bombs had been buried in the dirt. Ambushes were laid by fighters who typically kept a canal between themselves and their targets, preventing the Marines from employing their preferred tactic of rushing attackers. The patrol base was a target for rockets. The Marine unit that had lived in it for the past few weeks was leaving Afghanistan, ending its tour and passing to Fox Company a mission that would require small-unit gunfighting on someone else’s home ground. In his journal, Siatta recorded his first impression, in standard grunt-speak: “The coffee here tastes like shit.”",41,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By 2009, the eighth year of its Afghan occupation, the United States had repeatedly reshaped its reasons and practices for fighting its post-Sept. 11 wars. Under ideas in favor at this moment, nicknamed COIN, the military’s inelegant shorthand for its optimistically conceived counterinsurgency doctrine, troops were expected to follow a three-stage process to declaw and displace the Taliban: clear, hold and build. This meant sweeping through an area to weaken opposing fighting groups by force and then holding the ground and trying to secure it over time, all in the service of allowing the central government’s local project to take root and grow. At the same time, Marines were told to coach Afghan forces and befriend villagers (in part by handing out cash) and urge them into roles (informants, contractors, local officials) that would make them partners in the new way. They were also supposed to encourage farmers to abandon the cultivation of opium poppy, the region’s most lucrative cash crop.",42,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"That was the theory and the hope, often officially expressed. In practice it meant destroying a firmly established local economy and bringing in rule by outsiders. And the first phase — “clearing” — was a euphemism for violence, repeatedly applied via small gunfights and supported by American artillery and air power. A corollary, often unstated but understood by those doing the patrols, was that any group of Afghans willing to face the Marines head to head would gradually be thinned, while every seven months the Americans, bloodied and made jumpy by firefights and bombs, would be replaced with fresh troops. It was small-scale attrition warfare, with hearts-and-minds jive.",43,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s turn came quickly. On Nov. 2, his second day at the patrol base, Third Platoon was gathering to meet the Marines they were replacing when two rockets roared in and exploded, one inside and another outside the perimeter. Siatta ran for his equipment — flak jacket, helmet, first-aid kit and the rest — and stood with his rifle waiting for a ground attack that never came. He was at war now, “heart racin, hands shakin but had a smile on my face,” he wrote in his journal. “I dont know why I was smilin maybe it was because I could have got blown the fuck up and didn’t.”",44,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"To stop incoming rockets, the patrols would have to make the Taliban think twice about taking such risks. That night, Siatta was issued a Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle, the more accurate descendant of the M16, which he would carry throughout his tour, along with open-tip match-grade ammunition, a departure from the military’s standard full-metal jacket rounds that sacrificed armor penetration but caused more damaging soft-tissue wounds. The rifle was equipped with a suppressor to muffle its report. Siatta was a hunter now. Clearing the fields around Lakari was his job. He was 20 years old.",45,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On a section of steppe the Marines called “the eastern desert,” Siatta adjusted the rifle’s scope. His practice range, an empty expanse of compacted soil and tiny tufts of dried grass, was safe. The local fighters did not leave the security of their home turf to fight in the open. Like an athlete stretching on a sideline before competition, Siatta made his last preparations. Methodically firing into rations boxes, he determined and wrote down the data for exact distances, then set the scope for 300 yards and taped the chart to his rifle’s stock. He was ready.",46,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad was green. Its leader, Sergeant Perez, was the only Marine who had been in combat before. The first patrol passed without incident. But Fox Company was aggressive, and within days its Marines were pushing beyond where the departing unit had regularly gone. They were looking for fights.",47,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At the lower ranks of the Marine Corps, the Pentagon’s airbrushed language of war can fade away. Tactical slang hews closer to battlefield fact. Marines talk of “bait patrols,” in which one group of grunts heads off to a contested area trying to draw fire, while others wait, hoping that once the Taliban show themselves they can attack their flanks. And they talk of the most straightforward mission of all: movement to contact, which means exactly that.",48,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 7, Siatta’s squad, accompanied by Lieutenant Kurtz and a machine-gun team, headed just over a mile south and stopped beside a house to talk with whoever approached. Siatta’s journal entry that day was unequivocal about the purpose.",49,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Now let me be clear our mission was not to talk to the locales and shot the shit. Our mission was to get the Talibans atention and hopefully have them attach use and give there position away.,50,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The battalion leaving Afghanistan was opposed to the mission. Kurtz faced contradictory orders. His company commander was telling him to push south, while the operations officer in the command center was ordering him back. The Marines headed back.",51,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On the return walk, they were attacked. “Gunfire opens up out of a tree line,” Siatta’s journal reads. “Rounds cracking and snaping through the air and skipin across the ground.”",52,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad reacted as infantry units in their first firefight often do. Most of the Marines opened up with everything they had. Siatta found a position along a mud wall, fired a few shots and then stopped. Through his scope he saw nothing to shoot.",53,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Around him others cut loose. The squad’s M249 automatic weapons and M240 machine gun tore through belts of ammunition. The fire-team leaders lobbed one high-explosive 40-mm grenade after another. Lance Cpl. Dustin J. Hagglund, who led the machine-gun team, described it afterward as “an ammo dump, basically.” Two cows, he said, were cut in half. The firefight was of a familiar type: a swift and ferocious clash between combatants who scarcely glimpsed one another. Beyond signaling toughness and an eagerness to fight, it accomplished little. “We did the suppression, we closed with them and we pulled back,” Lance Cpl. Jeffrey Ratliff said. The Taliban also withdrew. No one, it seemed, had been struck.",54,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The Marines strode back to their patrol base, exuberant, riding the rush of having been under fire and coming out alive. This is one of war’s exhilarating drugs. It fueled backslaps and shouts. “Everyone was like high-fiving and everything,” Hagglund told me. “We were the first squad in the company to get in a firefight.”",55,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,A few minutes later Hagglund was in a bunker when a Toyota pickup rushed toward the gate. It stopped short. Its occupants hopped out and retrieved a wheelbarrow from the bed. A few Afghan soldiers ran to meet them. In the wheelbarrow was a small boy who had been shot through the skull.,56,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The bullet had struck above his left eyebrow and blown out the back of his head. But it had hit high enough that the child was still alive — unresponsive, breathing fitfully. The man pushing the wheelbarrow was his father. Siatta watched as the Marines took the child to their aid station and rested his shattered skull over a stainless-steel bowl. A corpsman tried to keep what was left of his head intact by cupping it in his hands. A sandstorm had blown up, grounding the helicopter fleet. It was a few hours before an aircraft took him away. Not long after, the radio brought word. The boy had died.",57,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Hagglund thought the child might be 4 years old. Siatta and Perez thought he might be 6. No one was exactly sure how he had been shot. Ratliff figured he was hit while running through the gunfight to save the cows. The corpsman who examined the wound said it was caused by a 5.56-millimeter bullet, which matched weapons that the Marines carried. Perez tried consoling his squad. “This is how it works,” he said. “Rounds go everywhere in firefights, and as hard as we try to prevent civilian casualties, this is going to happen sometimes.” He reminded them that they had not shot first. They were ambushed. But words, he knew, had limits. “My guys felt guilty,” he said.",58,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After the first night, the Marines barely discussed the boy’s death. “We just kind of did the man thing, and we did not talk about it ever again,” Perez said. Hagglund described a collective reticence. “None of us talked about our feelings,” he said. “We were gung-ho. We were taking care of business.” They bleached the stainless-steel bowl, ate out of it and went back out on patrols.",59,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was shaken. His training had not prepared him for what it felt like to look down after a gunfight upon a child with part of his head gone. “During all of our work-up, shooting targets, throwing grenades, doing all that, you never once saw kids mangled,” he told me. The boy reminded him of his niece. He was one firefight into the only line of work he had ever wanted and was confronted with “one of those sights — it was like maturity overnight, a sobering.”",60,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Fox Company intended to clear the area around Lakari quickly. The next week was a blur. “Nothing,” Siatta wrote in his journal, “but firefight, rockets, ambushes, post resuply missions and just chaos.”",61,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,And then he took his first clear shot.,62,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 17, the platoon commander, Kurtz, accompanied the squad, reinforced with a machine-gun team and Afghan soldiers, on a mission deep into Taliban turf. He had noticed a pattern. After each gunfight, the Taliban’s fighters seemed to withdraw to the same fields and buildings west of the bazaar. Kurtz was sick of it and planned to walk straight into their area, summon them to a fight and kill as many of them as he could. “It was a pure and simple movement to contact, and nothing else,” he said.",63,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad set off in midmorning. To Kurtz’s surprise, no Taliban fighters showed up. “Basically we humped all day,” he said. The squad continued a few miles west of the bazaar, into an area where no Marines had been before, when an ambush erupted around part of it. One team of Marines was filing across a field when the Taliban opened fire. The range was short. The ambushers were about 200 yards away. Following their training, the Marines in the kill zone turned toward the gunfire and charged. Those in the strip of vegetation between the fields alternated between shooting and rushing, trying to envelop the attackers.",64,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"An Afghan soldier fired a rocket-propelled grenade near the lieutenant, and the back blast nearly deafened him. The Taliban was firing with a PK machine gun, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. The squad was spread out, with Perez and Siatta moving with a team a few hundred yards off. Perez looked behind his Marines and saw a man on a roof about 300 yards away, partly hidden by a wall. He raised his four-power scope for a closer view. The man did not seem to be holding anything but was watching the fight, perhaps directing the Taliban.",65,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was beside Perez with an eight-power scope. Under the rules, Marines were required to have “PID” — positive identification — of a combatant before firing. Even warning shots were forbidden without an officer’s approval. Another platoon had recently shot an Afghan with a radio, only to discover that the radio was a harmless transistor for listening to the news and that the man had a mental disability. The Marines had been warned about avoiding more mistakes.",66,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta kept his sight on the man. He did not see a weapon, a radio or a cellphone. But he was suspicious. Perez told him to fire a warning shot and chase the man off. “I told Siatta to shoot under the guy,” he told me.",67,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta fired. The man collapsed. Perez lowered his M4 and looked down at Siatta. “Did you just shoot that man?” he asked.,68,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta nodded.,69,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Perez was astonished. But they were midway through a gunfight, with Marines pinned down in a field, and he understood that Siatta could have hit the man unintentionally. He decided to wait to confront him.",70,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad fought south for about 600 yards, clearing several buildings. At one point they were taking fire from a compound, and as Kurtz was organizing an airstrike, he saw, through a gap in the wall, a woman inside. She was holding a baby. Kurtz thought the Taliban might have pushed her into view as a human shield. He called off the airstrike. Some of the Marines watched several unarmed men sprinting away from a building they were closing on and asked for permission to shoot them. Kurtz thought the fleeing men were combatants who had ditched their weapons. But again, he said, he followed the rules. He ordered the squad not to fire. It was a maddening fight, under an ornate system of restrictions that the Taliban knew how to exploit, a style of war that could enrage those who followed it. “A lot of the guys in the squad were pissed at me that day,” Kurtz said.",71,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Back at their base, Perez asked Siatta to explain his shot. “Were you sighted on that guy?” he said.",72,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta, he said, answered, “Yes.”",73,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“He told me he wanted to feel what it was like to kill someone,” Perez later recalled.",74,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Perez was angry and concerned. He reported the incident to Kurtz, and the company began investigating Siatta. Kurtz, too, was disturbed. He sensed trouble. Villagers had been gathering at the gate, complaining about every mistake Fox Company made. Kurtz expected they would soon arrive with a body.",75,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He warned Siatta that he stood to face charges. “We’ll see how this plays out for you, bud,” he told him. Kurtz took away his rifle and suspended him from patrols. Siatta was near tears. Perez supported the lieutenant’s position and said he wondered about Siatta’s suitability for war. “There is a difference between wanting to kill a person and killing the right person,” he said. “Our concern was that Siatta would fall into the trap of killing for pleasure, which he had the ability to do.”",76,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Years later, the shot remains a point of contention. Siatta said he understood the reprimand but steadfastly defends his actions. “This is one of the stressors of being a designated marksman,” he told me. “You have to make that call. That guy was bad news. That was a shady guy.” In the same circumstance, he said, he would take the shot again. “You could save your buddies’ lives,” he said, “at the expense of your own ass.” Perez said these answers are unacceptable. “He can say the guy looked shady, but that doesn’t give you the right to shoot him,” he said. “If I let my squad shoot everyone who was shady, we could have killed an entire village.”",77,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"For a few days, Third Platoon patrolled without Siatta. Everyone waited. The villagers did not appear. A patrol to the building found no sign of anyone wounded. No blood, no bandages, no one making accusations. A body never turned up. Perez returned Siatta’s rifle and reinstated him.",78,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The fighting intensified, along with the frustration. On one mission, the platoon tried to capture a Taliban commander about six miles away. The man escaped. Siatta was so annoyed after listening to a “bullshit speech about even though we found nothing we still came out on top” from Cuomo, the company commander, that he wrote in his journal that he “wanted to punch him in the face.”",79,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Not yet two months into his tour, Siatta was no longer a naïve kid from the prairie. He had hardened, and was both angry and more alert. He was harboring doubts about the war. Marines were doing the most dangerous work and were told that Afghan forces were going to build on their success. After watching the Afghan soldiers his platoon worked with, Siatta was certain that was not going to happen. When he visited them in their tents, he said, “they’d be in there on their rugs, making chai, smoking dope. I’d be like: ‘You guys are fucking turds. We’re here to do shit, and you’re high as fuck.’?” When Marines patrolled, many of the Afghans stayed back.",80,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Always there was another patrol.,81,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 22, the Marines in another platoon were attacked, and when Third Platoon went to help they were ambushed, too — trapped by gunfire from multiple directions. Attack helicopters came to their aid, forcing back the Taliban.",82,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Once the ambush was broken, First Squad was ordered to sweep a compound from which the Taliban had been firing. A building inside had been hit with two Hellfire missiles. The squad crossed a cold, waist-deep canal and stacked at the entrance. Siatta was on point. They threw a fragmentation grenade over the compound wall, then followed it inside. As Siatta pushed through the gate, he saw the remains of an Afghan. His guts were exposed through disheveled clothes. He was maybe 14.",83,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"his stomach had been blown open and his intestense had spilled out onto the ground and his body had been peppered with pieces of the rocket. It was a fucked up thing to see. but I continued to clear into the first room on the left of the building and the first thing I see is an old man who was pretty much blown in half and his legs were hanging on by just tishues of skin. he was still alive if you want to call it that but he was still consious. it sounded like he was choking on his blood, he died minutes later, and the rest of the family who lived there were cut up by frag and debre.",84,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta watched the family file out — bereaved, terrified and covered in fine, powdery dust. They were powerless, unable to communicate with the Americans who stood in their home.",85,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The Marines were grieving, too. Lance Cpl. Nicholas Hand, from First Platoon, had been shot through the head and killed, perhaps by gunfire from that house. Another Marine had been hit in the leg. Kurtz said the platoon already sensed that the plans for Helmand were destined to fail. “It was obvious even then that this wasn’t going to work,” he said. “I think everyone understood that this was just going back to the Taliban again as soon as we leave.” He could see that some of his Marines were having difficulty processing it all. The misdirected carnage, the feeling that their sacrifices and risks were connected to a campaign that could not succeed — all of it, Kurtz said, preyed on their minds.",86,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta kept his feelings inside but described the episode bluntly in his journal: “Boy did we fuck that up.”,87,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Soon after, on Thanksgiving, his writing captured the funk into which he was descending.",88,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Today is just another day without my family holiday. Just dont mean anything. and really ever since my Dad past away holidays slowly every year lost their meaning. Im sitting here behind a 240 Bravo medium machine gun and Im supost to feel the holiday spirit, I think not. It hurts to think about how holidays used to be and that they used to mean something when I was a kid. but Im reminded every day out here that Im not a kid and yesterdays not today and never will be.",89,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s breakout moment happened on Nov. 29, as First Squad was attacked while crossing a field. This was by then a familiar event. The squad was spread out, and Siatta and three Marines were separated from most of the others, who took cover by a building and returned fire. Siatta and the exposed team, including Perez, were alone and unprotected. They scrambled for a ditch that was perhaps a foot deep. Bullets thudded all around as they huddled there.",90,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The only concealment was short grass. They tried to return fire, but each time they invited more bullets. They decided to dash across about 50 to 75 yards of open ground, to the ruins of an abandoned building. On a quick countdown — 3, 2, 1, go — they stood and bolted, sprinting for the better place, gambling that the Taliban would miss.",91,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"They reached the broken building. Siatta pressed himself chest down behind a mound of dirt, extended the bipods on his rifle, looked over the top and fired about 10 shots, roughly toward where the gunfire was coming from. Then he did what he had been trained to do. He slowed his breathing. He focused. As the bullets cracked by, he put his eye to the glass and considered his options. He wondered: Where would he be if he were them?",92,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"There was a building across the field. Siatta had a good feeling about it. He had settled in now, as if he were part of the earth. He pointed the scope toward the building’s left side and placed the cross hairs at the corner. He breathed slowly. He waited.",93,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A man stepped into the cross hairs. He was young, maybe in his 20s, wearing a white top and a dark vest. He held a Kalashnikov rifle. Siatta wasn’t sure of the range, but thought it might be 250 yards. His scope was set for 300. Expecting his bullet to strike slightly high, he rested the cross hairs below the man’s chest, slowly exhaled and eased the trigger back until he felt the rifle’s light kick.",94,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,The bullet struck the man near his genitals. Siatta watched him drop. It happened as Perez called a cease-fire.,95,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I just shot someone,” Siatta said.",96,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,“Is he dead?” the sergeant asked.,97,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta looked through the scope. The man writhed in the confused agony Marines call “the kicking chicken.” Siatta figured the open-tip bullet had torn out his buttocks. He fired a few more times. The man went still.,98,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“He is now,” Siatta said.",99,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,A second young man stepped out. Now Siatta knew the distance. The puzzle was solved. His first shot looked as if it hit squarely in his chest. The man collapsed.,100,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta felt relaxed. He kept his scope trained on the corner. A third man stepped out, reaching for one of the downed men. Siatta fired. The man spun and stumbled away. Siatta thought he had hit his arm.",101,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Perez watched through his four-power scope. “It was almost like a video game — I know that sounds ridiculous,” he said. “But one guy stepped into the open, and Siatta shot him, and he dropped violently, and then another guy stepped into the open, and Siatta shot, and that guy went down violently, and then a third guy came out, and Siatta hit him too.” Siatta, he said, “was basically the main effort of the entire squad.”",102,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"As the squad waited for Siatta to take another shot, the corner exploded in fire and dust. Other Marines had seen the Taliban fighters, too, through the sight on a TOW missile system. Kurtz had cleared them to shoot, ending the fight.",103,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta now had undisputed combat kills. At first it felt good. His doubts had been erased. “I’d wondered: Can I deliver? Am I just a target shooter? Will I let my guys down?” The cloud over the previous shot, for which he had risked a criminal charge, was evaporating.",104,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,His satisfaction was temporary. War plays on the mind. Marksmanship can seem simple one moment and complicated the next. Siatta’s doubts nagged him anew. He wondered if the kills were luck. “Was it a fluke?” he asked himself. “Was I a good-enough shot?” Other thoughts plumbed darker depths. Siatta had been curious about what it felt like to kill. His journal shows his unease upon finding out.,105,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,It was a great day and one of the worst days Iv had so far. Today I thought my family was going to get a folded flag and bullshit letter saying wat a great Marine I am and shit like that but I made it.,106,2017

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In the next two weeks, Siatta shot at least six and perhaps as many as 10 more people, according to his diary and Marines present.",108,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On a Dec. 10 patrol that would become the most significant mission of Fox Company’s tour, the platoon departed on a raid to capture a Taliban commander whom Special Operations forces were trying to arrest. The weather had turned bad, no aircraft were flying and the commander was reported to be in a compound west of the bazaar.",109,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The Marines seized the compound but did not find him. They settled inside, listening with an interpreter to intercepted Taliban radio chatter. Their foes were saying they had found the Americans’ boot prints in the fields but were not sure where they had gone. Soon the Taliban figured it out. The platoon came under attack from three sides.",110,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Kurtz was organizing the fight when he received an unexpected order. The Taliban boss was now said to be in a building in the bazaar. Third Platoon was to go there and catch him. Until then, the bazaar was considered so dangerous that the Marines were told not to approach it. The platoon had assumed that when the time came to clear it, the entire company would be involved in a large planned operation. Now the platoon — about 40 Marines, already under fire — was to rush there immediately. Kurtz dryly calls the mission “Operation Santa Claus — because you had to be 8 years old to believe it.”",111,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"It was during this confusion, he said, that Siatta solidified the respect of his peers. He had climbed onto a shed roof with another Marine and was watching over the platoon’s movements when the Taliban started shooting again. The roof was flimsy, made of thin branches. The two Marines were exposed, with only a sack of grain and an empty 55-gallon drum to hide behind.",112,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Kurtz, overwhelmed and unsure about how best to organize the platoon’s movement with the Taliban seeming to swarm around them, watched from below as Siatta scanned the farmland. He heard the distinct sound of a suppressed Mark 12, something between a metallic click and the snap of a whip. Siatta had seen two men, he said, and with a few shots killed them both. “It’s done,” he said, and slipped to the ground. The platoon crossed the field.",113,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The fighting grew into a rolling battle, with lulls followed by fresh clashes. Another platoon joined in. During one skirmish, Siatta said, he hit a Taliban fighter carrying a machine gun as he hustled across a bridge. It was a long, difficult shot. He judged the distance before killing the man by watching the arc of machine-gun tracers as another Marine fired bursts that missed.",114,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Later, Siatta was with another squad as it hurried across yet another dangerous area. The Marines took fire from behind. Most of them ran for a canal and slid down its bank, but Siatta remained in the open. Kurtz watched as he took a knee, assuming a position Marines practice on rifle ranges. Alone, under fire, with neither cover nor concealment, Siatta was visibly relaxed. Through his scope he spotted a fighter with a rifle about 250 yards away, lurking in a shadow by a wall. Siatta fired twice.",115,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The first round missed, striking the wall to the man’s left. Siatta moved the cross hairs right. The second shot hit. “He’s down, sir,” Siatta said to an incredulous Kurtz as he rejoined the squad. Kurtz describes the moment with something like awe. “The small-arms fire we were taking just ended,” he said, “and never started up again.”",116,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After the operation the Marines held the bazaar. The pace of fighting subsided. Kurtz finished Operation Santa Claus with an indelible sense of debt to Siatta, who he said kept the platoon safe during the worst of its tour. “I’d do anything for Sammy,” he told me. “All of us owe him a lot. He killed people who would have killed other people, including some of us.” He also said that Siatta’s controversial shot early in the fighting, at the man on the roof, may have been the right call. “He probably had a good gut instinct, in retrospect.”",117,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"No matter these feelings, Kurtz speaks of his former D.M. with sadness. Siatta’s transformation, he said, was welcomed on the battlefield but is painful to think about now. “Watching Sam evolve from that sweet, innocent kid to that killer he became, the killer we needed him to be,” he said, “it breaks my heart.”",118,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta, as he fought, had narrowed his thoughts to basic impulses and simple goals. “You are not fighting for America,” he said. “You are not fighting for the Marine Corps. You are just a bunch of 19-year-olds trying to make it to chow.” His journal entry after the fight for the bazaar described the self-loathing of a warrior disgusted by his own success.",119,2017

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad captured a wounded Taliban fighter, shot through the knee. When a medevac helicopter came, Perez opted to evacuate the prisoner and not Siatta. He regrets the choice, because it denied Siatta the medical documentation necessary for a Purple Heart. A corpsman cleaned and bandaged Siatta’s face, and they hiked back to their outpost. Perez said he tried to submit Siatta for a Purple Heart, but the company blocked it, saying the wounds were not serious enough. “I was upset about that, because if he didn’t have his goggles, he would have lost an eye,” Perez told me. “I felt personally responsible for it. I didn’t medevac him. I felt personally responsible for denying him what he deserved.”",129,2017

Maureen had been almost entirely out of touch with him throughout his tour. Siatta had written home rarely. His calls were infrequent and short.",135,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Maureen booked a room near the base and spent a weekend trying to reconnect with her son. Siatta did not sleep at night and did not leave his bed most of the day. He spoke very little. Maureen watched him, saddened and concerned. She settled on an accommodating explanation, telling herself he was exhausted and jet-lagged, still living on the Afghan time zone.",136,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Several days later, in May, the Marine Corps granted Siatta post-deployment leave, which he spent at his mother’s home. President Obama was visiting Illinois for Memorial Day, and Siatta was invited to a presidential ceremony at a cemetery in Elwood. It was a short drive, and he would have been the perfect prop: the infantry Marine freshly returned from Obama’s surge. He refused to attend. At his trial, when asked why he declined, he dismissed any interest in public ritual. “Maybe because my experiences in Afghanistan didn’t feel so great for me,” he said. “I don’t know. I don’t think a parade was the most fitting thing.”",137,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Maureen noticed that he still kept night hours. She lived in a two-bedroom apartment and worked days at a pharmacy. At night she watched him brood. Siatta had never been a drinker and was allergic to beer. Now he was drinking heavily and for hours on end. Many nights he left for bars. She asked him how, at 20, he was able to buy alcohol. He told her that when he showed military identification, he had no trouble. When he came home, he was awake almost until morning, pacing, getting drunker on liquor he poured himself.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Several times that week he blacked out. Maureen was unsure what to think or do. He told her nothing of Afghanistan, of the killing he had seen and done. She did not intervene. “I just thought maybe he had to clear his head,” she said. “I figured: ‘Let him go. He’s got to clear his head.’?”",144,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Returning to Camp Lejeune after his leave, Siatta fell into a similar pattern. The corps considered him tested now. He received his medal. The battalion’s Scout Sniper Platoon recruited him, and he left Fox Company to join them. He loaded up on tattoos, including a sword-wielding Lady Justice on his chest and abdomen, topped with seven hash marks for men he claimed as kills. The Marines he deployed with were coming of age. There had been little opportunity to spend money in Afghanistan, and many returned with savings. Some bought cars. They were turning 21 and could legally visit bars. On weekends, groups of them would take trips, sometimes to the beach. Siatta rarely went along. “He kind of went into a shell,” Ratliff said. “I’d invite him out, and he was like, ‘No, I just want to stay in my room.’?”",145,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta wrote to Ashley Volk. She was a college student and aerial dancer now, with an apartment in Chicago’s West Humboldt Park neighborhood. He flew to meet her. Their first night together was surreal. Siatta was quieter than usual and emanated discipline and self-control. Volk had always been outgoing and talkative; they had joked for years that she was his opposite. Looking at him after their long separation, she sensed that something troubled him. She tried drawing him out.",146,2017

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"That night they made love. “I felt our old connection,” she said. Immediately after, Siatta withdrew. As she lay beside him, he reached for a blanket and wrapped it tightly around his body, with all his limbs tucked inside. He was like a Marine sleeping on hard ground, plank straight, self-contained, cocooned, alone. She passed the night uneasily. “No contact, no cuddling, no pillows,” Volk said. “He was there. But he was gone.”",149,2017

On his last visit to Chicago, Siatta gave Volk his Afghan diary. He had thought of destroying it but decided to entrust it to her. She read the first page and stopped. They had a day and a half together before he shipped out, and she was emotionally stretched as it was. “I was hugging him, telling him I was going to kidnap him,” she said.",151,2017

He stopped answering her letters.",157,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The war in Libya did not require him to go ashore. The ships made port visits in Europe, where Siatta and his friends were given time off, much of which was spent binge-drinking. “Whenever we had free time, we all got lit up,” he told me. In February 2012, the battalion returned to Camp Lejeune. His time in the corps was soon up. He left the service unceremoniously and drove home to Illinois in a used Chevy he bought with his combat pay. He did not tell Volk he was back. She began dating another man.",158,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta sought an even quieter life than before. His family noticed his anger, his social withdrawal and what they now acknowledge as his alcoholism. He seethed at his mother for putting a welcome-home message on a sign at a local McDonald’s. “I don’t want anybody looking at me,” he told her. He seemed intent on near anonymity and on avoiding discussion of the war. “He wanted no one to know that he had been there,” she testified at his trial. “He didn’t want anyone saying, ‘Thank you for your service.’ He wanted nothing. He wanted to be left alone.”",159,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta spent more than a year living in his mother’s home. He did not contact Volk and assumed she had moved on. For months, he was listless. “How did you spend your time?” one of his lawyers asked at trial. “I didn’t,” Siatta replied. “I would say I probably sat in my room, nothing.” Inside his bedroom, his mother said, he drank and played video games. She would rest on a couch near his door, listening through the night. “I used to hear him hitting the wall,” she said.",160,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"As a teenager Siatta had cut the lawn of Larry Stonitsch, a former Marine who owned Rovanco Piping Systems, a manufacturer of insulated pipe in Joliet. Now Stonitsch offered him a job at the factory. Siatta was reliable and quiet and did not talk about his combat service. Stonitsch understood. “I had a stepdad who was in the Battle of the Bulge and never was right after that, after the things he saw and did,” he told me. “He drank too much. So I have some empathy for that.”",161,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Outside Rovanco, Siatta was barely functioning. He shrank his social world ever smaller, to the point of skipping family gatherings. In 2013, convinced her son had stagnated, Maureen suggested he consider college. He was eligible for G.I. Bill benefits, she told him, and should take them. “Here is where my guilt comes in, because I am the one who talked him into going to school,” Maureen said. “I kind of wonder, if he had stayed here, if we would have figured out that he needed services, and he would have gotten treatment.”",162,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta enrolled in Joliet Junior College that summer and transferred to Illinois State in the fall. He had no academic focus, no plan beyond enrolling in the minimum number of credits to receive the G.I. Bill’s monthly housing allowance. School brought him neither sanctuary nor inspiration. Classroom environments made him anxious; the bustle of students kept him vigilant. He could not relate to most classmates, who had little sense of where he had been. Often he spent weekends at his mother’s house.",163,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By spring he was on a trajectory to fail. He stopped doing homework, then stopped attending most classes. Many days he stayed in the room rented with his housing allowance, in bed. He slept until afternoon and did not eat until almost evening. When he did socialize, he would drink first, heavily, to dull his anxiety. Two years out of the Marine Corps, Siatta was doing little more than staying alive.",164,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Saturday, April 12, 2014, Siatta was invited by a young woman he had met the week before to a house party a block from where he lived. Around 10 p.m., alone in his basement bedroom, he opened a bottle of Don Julio tequila and started pouring shots. By the time he left for the party with Mark Kramer, a Navy-veteran friend who dropped by, the bottle was almost empty.",165,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had been at the party a few minutes, hanging out on the front porch, when he thought he heard another guest say something rude to his host. Without warning, or even speaking, Siatta sucker-punched him in the face and knocked him to the floor. The man, a coach at a CrossFit, was not seriously hurt. But the hosts and guests were startled, and Siatta was asked to leave. Kramer walked him home, where he encouraged him to apologize and asked if he was suffering from PTSD. The two men returned to the party, only to be told again to leave. This time the woman who invited Siatta escorted him back to his house, leaving him outside his door.",166,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta tried to call or text the woman. From there, he said, his memories stop. What he did next, step by step, is not clear. But at some point he set out into the neighborhood. Shortly after 2 a.m. he smashed through the back door of 706 Samantha Street, where the female teaching students lived. It was perhaps 100 feet away from the party.",167,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At first the former Marine inside did not see Siatta.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"For a minute or so, nothing happened. The man later told the police that Siatta might have descended to the basement, which was accessible through a door in the dining area.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,A Life Flight helicopter rushed him to Peoria. The knife that had plunged into his neck missed his carotid artery and jugular vein.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta woke the next day. His first thought was that he had been mugged or struck by a car. Two detectives entered his room, turned on a digital audio recorder and read him his rights. Siatta was on pain medication. He asked them to leave.",183,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Whether Siatta remembered it or not, he had committed a serious crime. The case gained momentum swiftly. In late April, a grand jury indicted Siatta on charges of home invasion causing harm — a Class X felony, the second-most serious category of crime in the Illinois penal code. The charge carried a mandatory sentence of six to 30 years, putting Siatta’s offense in the same league as aggravated kidnapping or the predatory sexual assault of a child. Barring a plea deal or an acquittal, he was on a path to prison.",184,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The news took time to reach Siatta. That same month, he had entered a residential substance-abuse rehabilitation program at a V.A. hospital west of Chicago, where combat-based PTSD, depressive disorder and alcohol-use disorder were diagnosed. The V.A. prescribed him Xanax and hydroxyzine for anxiety and approved roughly $1,300 a month in disability benefits for service-connected depression and PTSD. Six weeks later, Siatta transferred to a federal health care center in North Chicago for more inpatient counseling.",185,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"When Siatta checked out of the hospital in July, he turned himself in for booking. The evidence against him was strong. His mother retained a private criminal defense lawyer, Hal Jennings, who approached prosecutors about a plea to a lesser felony and a sentence of probation. Siatta had no previous criminal record. The man he had fought had not been seriously hurt. Given Siatta’s combat service and apparent post-combat illness, Jennings considered it a reasonable request. But Kristin Alferink, the assistant state’s attorney handling Siatta’s prosecution, was firm. In September, she offered a plea to the original charge and a 10-year prison term. Jennings rejected it. “I was not under any circumstances going to plead that kid into prison,” he said.",186,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The state’s inflexibility in part reflected the wishes of the man who had fought Siatta. Since the struggle in the kitchen, he had suffered from insomnia and was having difficulties in crowds or when people approached him from behind. “I’m completely paranoid of everything,” he told me. He tried to make his house feel safer, he said, by having it “wired to the gills with security cameras.” He slept with a loaded Walther P38 pistol by his bed. He still found it difficult to relax. “The heater goes off,” he said, “and I jump back five feet.” It was as if some of Siatta’s PTSD symptoms had been transferred to him. He entered therapy and started taking anti-anxiety medication. But he remained angry. He knew little of Siatta’s service in the Marine Corps. It might not have changed his feelings if he did. “He could have been Jesus incarnate,” he said, “and I still would have wanted blood.”",187,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Jennings and a partner, Carey J. Luckman, prepared for trial. They gathered military records and character recommendations from Siatta’s supervisors in the Marines. They also arranged for him to undergo a second psychological evaluation. In May 2015, he was reviewed by Don R. Catherall, a psychologist specializing in trauma disorders and a Marine veteran of Vietnam. Catherall’s report echoed the V.A.’s diagnoses of PTSD and severe alcohol-use disorder, and noted that Siatta had not had a drink in more than a year. This, he wrote, “officially constitutes remission of the substance-use disorder.” He added, “As long as he remains sober, he is unlikely to repeat the behaviors that led to this unfortunate situation.”",188,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"That summer, not long after Siatta’s evaluation, Ashley Volk called him. She was angry about how he had cut her off, wounded by his silence. He said he had been hurt and was getting it taken care of. She was worried, but he assured her it was not serious. In July, she asked him to meet for burgers at the Lockdown Bar & Grill, a prison-themed bar in Chicago. Upon seeing him, she said, she immediately fell back in love. After three hours of talking, they kissed.",189,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"They spent the night together in her apartment. She saw the new scars on his neck, shoulder and arm and assumed something else had happened to him in the Marines. They became a couple again. Siatta was still closed off to most people, but he began to tell her about Afghanistan. Maybe, she thought, he was finally opening up. He did not tell her anything of the home invasion, or that he was awaiting trial.",190,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s prospects for avoiding prison were likely to rise or fall depending on whether a judge and a jury would be willing to view his combat experience, and his self-medicating with alcohol, as factors in the home invasion and fight. In September 2015, Jennings and Alferink, the prosecutor, traveled to North Chicago to depose Sheilah C. Perrin, a psychologist supervising Siatta’s treatment for the V.A. Under questioning by Jennings, Perrin laid out her views, noting that Siatta, who was also present, had entered 30 to 40 compounds containing insurgents. She described common behaviors for veterans with such histories: reclusion, avoiding crowds, unceasing vigilance and using alcohol as a coping technique “to escape from their pain and from their memories.” She listed Siatta’s diagnoses and said that once Siatta entered a strange home and was confronted inside, the knife would have been a “huge, huge, huge trigger.” Her assessment was unambiguous. “He needs treatment,” she said. By the end of the questioning, she had teared up.",191,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Alferink pushed hard, inquiring why Perrin had been “emotional” and asking whether she had the “same empathy and thankfulness” for the man Siatta had fought, who was also a veteran. During a half-hour of often-testy exchanges, Alferink proposed that Siatta’s PTSD was not related to his combat service and suggested that his use of alcohol was “similar to somebody who just broke up with their boyfriend” or “who couldn’t cope with losing a job.”",192,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Jennings still thought he had a strong defense. The character references from Marines were glowing, and he was ready to argue that the fight in the kitchen was a conditioned reflex for a troubled man with Siatta’s combat record.",193,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A few weeks before the trial, Jennings was discussing the case with Siatta’s mother, Maureen, when she mentioned that her son had kept a journal in Afghanistan. Siatta had recently retrieved it from Volk. Jennings asked to see it. It was a small tan notebook on which Siatta had drawn a human skull with a cracked forehead. When Jennings started reading, he could not stop. On Oct. 22, 2015, less than three weeks before the trial, he entered a copy of the journal into the court record. “This is the key,” he told Maureen. “This is what could win your case.”",194,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By then Siatta had graduated from a substance-abuse program and been sober for a year and half. He was in counseling. He suffered from anxiety, but less acutely, allowing him to stop taking Xanax and hydroxyzine. He was exercising, taking up martial arts and weight lifting again. It helped his moods. His relationship with Volk softened his antisocial side. Jennings asked Alferink to read the diary and consider Siatta’s last night of drinking and the home invasion in light of his combat service and PTSD, and his apparent progress since. He hoped the state would consider a better plea deal. “If Sam didn’t have the best mitigation package in the world, who did?” he said.",195,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Alferink, in keeping with the wishes of the man who had fought Siatta, declined to change the offer. Ten years in prison, or trial.",196,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The trial opened on Nov. 9. Jennings and Luckman hoped the judge would allow jurors to consider Siatta’s actions a result of involuntary intoxication. This defense had precedent in Illinois among defendants who had been drugged by others, but not with defendants trying to drown PTSD with alcohol. The state tried to quash the argument outright. Alferink told the court that “the reason why he consumed the alcohol has nothing to do with this case.” She added: “He could have consumed the alcohol because he was suffering from PTSD and wanted to be able to go to a party. Again, he could have consumed the alcohol because he was trying to get over a breakup, because he just lost a job. The reason for the underlying alcohol consumption does not matter.”",197,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At each opportunity for sympathy, the state moved against. In jury selection, Alferink asked whether any of the potential jurors had military experience. Two said they did — a former Navy petty officer and a Marine reservist who had been injured in an accident in Afghanistan. Alferink had them excused from serving on the jury. This denied Siatta, in Jennings’s view, a trial by peers. “She excluded the only people who had any chance of understanding this defendant and what he went through,” he said.",198,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s lawyers did not dispute the central facts of the case. But Catherall, the psychologist, offered a profile of Siatta as a Marine utterly unmoored by war. “Seeing these children die as the result of what he went over there to try and do in a positive way was kind of shattering for him,” he told the jury.",199,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Alferink countered by asking how much Catherall was being paid as a defense witness — he said his rate was $300 an hour — and sketched him as a shill.,200,2017

Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"But Drazewski added that he was hearing the case as a judge, not just a citizen, and because of mandatory-sentencing guidelines he had no option of assigning Siatta to probation. “Although it is with regret,” he said, “I’m still required to follow the law.” He sentenced Siatta to six years in prison, the legal minimum — four years less than the prosecutors had offered in their plea deal.",208,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta passed the next month at the Stateville Correctional Center, awaiting transfer to the prison where he would serve his sentence. Inmates in reception status have few privileges. Siatta was on 24-hour lockdown and received no visitors. His cellblock seemed to him like an enormous warehouse, with inmates in cells stacked upon cells. The air filled with their din.",209,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"During 28 days there, he said, he rarely left his cell. Meals were delivered to the door and eaten inside. Every Tuesday he was allowed out for a shower, in a stall where the water was scalding hot. His cell did not have a window, and the lights were never off. Between the noise and the incessant brightness, he slept fitfully. As he lost his sense of time, he was not sure when he was supposed to rest. He remembers seeing a clock once, during a group orientation. It said 9 a.m. By his estimate, he had eaten breakfast seven hours before. His anxiety rose again, and when he asked for medications, none were provided, he said, though he had a diagnosis and prescriptions from the V.A.",210,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A schedule took shape. He would lie on his bunk until breakfast, then eat and get back on the bunk until lunch. After lunch he would do squats and push-ups, then return to the bunk until dinner. Each day he received a carton of milk. A previous inmate had accumulated enough cartons to make a crude deck of playing cards, which he had left in the cell for others. Siatta did not use them. He felt himself sliding into a mental hibernation. He managed to send Volk a short letter.",211,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I love you so very much my love,” he wrote. “You are my one and only, and I promise. I love you so so so much and we will have a life filled with love and happiness. To my pretty gypsy, from your love, Samuel.”",212,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He didn’t know what else to say. The legal system bewildered him, and he found it hard to think in concrete terms, beyond that he had to leave.",213,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Outside the prison, his new lawyer, Richard Winter, was preparing an appeal. Winter had agreed to represent Siatta in late 2015, between the conviction and the sentencing. A partner at Holland & Knight, an international firm, he specialized in commercial and antitrust litigation from his 30th-floor office in downtown Chicago. He had no experience in criminal law and had taken Siatta as a client via a peculiar impulse. Holland & Knight offers pro bono representation to clients who cannot otherwise afford it. Over the years, Winter had helped autistic children in court fights against school districts in and around Chicago and had worked on Hague Convention cases, trying to reunite children with parents in international custody disputes. In November 2015, he had just read “Rogue Lawyer,” a novel by John Grisham about Sebastian Rudd, a bourbon-drinking, gun-carrying lawyer with a bulletproof van who fights for justice for unappealing clients. Winter was amused by Rudd, a cartoonish figure. He was also impressed by his legal tactics, which he thought were able. Soon after finishing the book, Winter received an officewide email describing Siatta’s case and asking if anyone wanted to step in. He figured this was a case for someone of Rudd’s talents, and it looked interesting on the merits. He volunteered to try.",214,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Two weeks later, he met Siatta and his mother at a rest stop on Interstate 294. Siatta impressed him. He was in his last weeks of freedom before an expected prison term and was on his way home from PTSD counseling. Winter read the case file, looking for a basis for appeal. He attended the sentencing hearing in January and watched his new client depart for prison. The judge allowed Siatta about a minute with his mother, and after he was gone Maureen lingered in the courtroom, then in the hallway. She looked numb. Winter told her, “I’ll see what I can do.”",215,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Winter knew the appeal would consume much of 2016. He also figured that while he might persuade the appellate court to consider a retrial, allowing a judge to instruct jurors to consider an involuntary-intoxication defense, the chances were probably slim. And even if the judges granted a new trial, he knew, Siatta would still need to prevail before a jury, of which there was no guarantee. Winter’s backup plan was to seek a pardon from the Illinois governor after the appeals process was exhausted. Either way, Siatta was not coming home anytime soon.",216,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By March, the state had moved Siatta from Stateville to Shawnee, where inmates lived in two-story X-shaped buildings, called houses, each with a central station from which guards watched over the population. Siatta was assigned to a cell in 4-House. It was a drab and musty place with missing floor tiles, an upper and lower bunk, a toilet and a small steel sink. His cellmate, a moody man with a thin mustache, was doing time for failing to register as a sex offender.",217,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Early each morning, the locks would click open. Inmates could step into the cellblock corridor and file into the darkness and cold for a short walk to the cafeteria for breakfast and a cup of water. The routine was repeated for lunch and dinner. The schedule also allowed for about an hour of “day room” time — to lift weights in the open-air yard, use telephones in a call center or buy food and toiletries in the commissary with money their families added to their prison accounts.",218,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Buying extra food drew attention. In the cash-free ecosystem of prison, purchases became currency. A T-shirt, a coffee cup, a package of cookies — these could be traded or gambled. They also attracted thieves.",219,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The guards tended to cluster in the central section of each house, and they ventured only occasionally into the cellblock corridors. This meant that when the locks were released, there was a moment in which inmates could furtively enter one another’s cells. Siatta returned from one meal to find about $50 worth of food stolen. His cellmate was enraged at the breach of turf. He told other inmates that he would find the thief and punish him.",220,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had probably seen more violence in his life than anyone else in 4-House. But he understood that fighting as an inmate carried special risks, and not of injury. If the guards discovered a fight, everyone involved could be taken to solitary confinement — called “seg” for “segregation” — and have their prison records marked up. This could prevent an early release. Siatta’s case was on appeal. He could not afford trouble. He tried talking his cellmate down. “I got a lot of stuff going on,” he told him. “I got a good case. I can’t be getting into fights, going to seg, getting new charges over some tuna packet.”",221,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"One day during day-room time, a few gang members appeared in the corridor near their door. Siatta’s cellmate had heard who the thief was and had been giving him angry looks. The man wanted to know why. “I’m coming to the conclusion you stole our stuff,” the cellmate said.",222,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta did not want to be involved. He slipped out of the cell, and the gang member stepped in, while his friends stood casually in the hallway.",223,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The fight lasted maybe 15 seconds. One gang member watching from the corridor looked into the cell and pronounced the fight over, and the group broke up and drifted away.",224,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s cellmate was left on the floor. He had been beaten badly. He had a gash in his head, which had been slammed against the steel bunk. He was bleeding all over the tiles. Siatta examined the wound and knew it needed medical attention. But the man refused to approach the guards. He told Siatta he would stay in the cell for a few weeks and eat commissary food until the bruises and cuts healed.",225,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The plan did not last long. The guards opened an investigation. Six inmates were sent to seg, Siatta said, including the two who had fought. Siatta was transferred to another house.",226,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"His new cellmate was a member of the Latin Kings; among his many tattoos was the gang’s symbol, a five-point crown. He laid down the rules. “In here, this house, it’s our house, and we’re cool,” he said of their cell. “But out there you are not affiliated, and if you get in trouble I can’t help you.” Siatta left Shawnee for a court appearance related to his appeal and was held at the decrepit Pontiac Correctional Center before returning to Shawnee and a cell with another Latin King. The same code applied: We get along inside the cell. Out there we don’t know each other.",227,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta never quite found a friend. He tried participating in a veteran-support group but saw it as a sham. In his first session, when inmates were introducing themselves, an attendee claiming to be a former Marine mangled Marine Corps jargon. The counselor asked the man, who looked to be in his 30s, what rank he had held.",228,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“General,” the inmate proudly answered.",229,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta had heard enough. He never attended again.,230,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Each day Siatta had phone privileges. But calls to his mother, which he yearned for, usually left him disappointed. He would ask if there was news about his appeal, he said, “and it was always just, ‘No.’?” The counseling he had attended at the V.A. with a therapist who knew him was replaced by a once-a-month, 15-minute mental-health checkup. “It was basically: ‘Do you want to hurt someone? Do you want to hurt yourself?’ and ‘All right, see you next month,’?” he said. Depression gripped him again.",231,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He tried exercising during his yard time, knowing it soothed his symptoms. Some weeks he managed to work out in committed bursts, though three or four inmates were usually lined up at each piece of equipment, waiting a turn. But as his depression settled over him, he passed his weeks passively, unable to push through the pack. Mostly he slept — an activity he was assured of, because his cellblock was on lockdown 21 hours a day.",232,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In April, as Siatta brooded in prison, I wrote to Scott Drazewski, the judge who had not wanted to send him there. He declined to discuss the case. State rules, he said by email, prohibited judges from commenting on matters under appeal. But after visiting Siatta in Shawnee, I met with Donald D. Bernardi, a retired state judge and former peer of Drazewski’s, who understood how mandatory-sentencing rules had forced Drazewski to incarcerate Siatta.",233,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Bernardi knew the outlines of Siatta’s criminal file. I shared details from his combat tour: the boy shot through the head, the civilians struck by Hellfire missiles, Siatta’s run of methodical killing in late 2009. It was all news to him. We talked about the frustration and anger many combat veterans share as their wars have dragged on with no visible end, and how Siatta’s depression and PTSD were not unusual. We discussed the words of support from Cuomo, Siatta’s former commander. “Having watched and fought, up close and personal, with Mr. Siatta, I remain humbled by his incredibly courageous actions,” he had written. We also talked about the severity of Siatta’s crime. A man of his background smashing into anyone’s home was a frightening prospect.",234,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Bernardi’s reaction surprised me. He looked at my notebook on the table, in a way those familiar with reporters do when they are about to say something quotable, and said, “If this case does not call for mitigation, then mitigation has no meaning.”",235,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The county’s legal circle is small. Bernardi said the elected state’s attorney, Jason Chambers — Alferink’s boss — had practiced in his courtroom early in his career. “He’s a good guy,” he said, a reasonable lawyer who could see more than one side of an issue.",236,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A few hours later, I met Chambers in his office for a conversation with him and Alferink. We reprised the conversation with Bernardi. Alferink politely excused herself for a scheduled court appearance. Chambers was pleasant but inscrutable. I told him I planned to visit the crime scene and talk with the people who were in the house when Siatta broke in, and would get back to the prosecutors with questions.",237,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I was in New England two days later when Chambers sent me a text message. He asked for a phone number for Richard Winter, Siatta’s attorney. That afternoon he called Winter and made an unsolicited proposal. He was ready to vacate Siatta’s conviction, he said, and allow him to leave prison and plead to a lesser charge with a sentence of probation. And he was willing to make it easy. He wanted Winter to get documentation from the V.A. confirming that Siatta would be enrolled in mental-health care. Once he had it, the state would ask the appellate court to let Siatta out of Shawnee — immediately. They would work out the new plea deal later.",238,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta was asleep on his bunk on the afternoon of May 19 when he heard a voice on the intercom saying his door was to be unlocked and he should approach the guards’ station. A guard told him that he needed to go for fingerprinting. This made little sense to him; the Department of Corrections already had his prints.,239,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Until this point Siatta had little inkling of his shift in fortunes. Winter had kept his mother up to date on Chambers’s plans, but she did not want her son crestfallen if they stalled or were rejected in appellate court. She had told him only that Winter was working on his case and that “there might be some news one of these days.”",240,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"That afternoon, after lawyers and the appellate-court clerk refined the language and conditions for a court order, the appellate judges issued an order to release Siatta on a $10,025 bond, pending disposition of his appeal.",241,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A guard escorted him to a prison office. Siatta was unsure what was happening. “They asked me, ‘Where’s your property?’?” he told me later that day. “And I was like: ‘Why? Why do I need my property?’ And they said, ‘Because you are going home.’?”",242,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was escorted back to his cell with a plastic bin to collect his possessions. The guard gave him three minutes — barely enough time to hand off a coffee cup and about 20 packages of ramen noodles and chocolate-chip cream pies to his latest cellmate, who was serving 12 years.",243,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I’m going home,” Siatta said.",244,2017

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I guess my lawyer is working on some stuff, and I’m getting out of here,” Siatta said.",246,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The cellmate, whose prospective parole date is in 2022, shook his head.",247,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Minutes later, Siatta was gone, walking down the cellblock, carrying the bin. The prison officials inventoried his possessions — a hot pot, a few books and magazines, a pair of plastic flip-flops — and handed him an envelope with $63.90 in cash, the balance from his commissary account. Someone gave him a pair of gray sweatpants and a white T-shirt, and Siatta changed out of his prison blues. He kept the white sneakers with his inmate number, Y11107, handwritten on the side. He looked very much a prisoner still. A guard told him to sit and wait. His possessions were transferred to a cardboard box.",248,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After an hour or two, Siatta was led through a series of heavy doors to Shawnee’s reception area, where T.G. Taylor, the former Army officer who first told me of Siatta’s incarceration, was waiting. “Hey,” Siatta said and smiled lightly. Taylor explained that he would be driving him to a motel in Marion, where his mother would meet him. They spoke in the clipped language of two grunts readying for a patrol.",249,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,“Are you good?” Taylor asked.,250,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I am good,” Siatta said. He walked across the lot, past the guards’ cars, with an expressionless face. In the car, he was subdued. He ate a cheeseburger as Taylor tried to explain what just happened. “I had no idea,” Siatta said.",251,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Taylor called Maureen. “We have him,” he said. Maureen had posted his bond in Bloomington and was en route to meet them. Siatta took the phone. “Hey, Mom, how you doing? I’m good. What? I did, yeah. Where you guys at? An hour and 10 minutes away. You’ve seen Shawnee before. It’s not great. Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.”",252,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He hung up. Behind the wheel, Taylor had a wad of snuff tobacco behind his bottom lip. There had been no tobacco in prison. “You, uh, wouldn’t have a pinch of that Copenhagen, would you?” Siatta asked.",253,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Taylor shared what he had and pulled into a convenience store to buy another can. He asked Siatta to wait in the car. He had been released so quickly that he risked being mistaken for an escapee.,254,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In the motel lot beside the highway, Taylor opened a duffel, found a workout shirt and tossed it to him. Siatta now looked like the free man he was. He headed to the motel coffee bar, made a tall cup and positioned himself with his back to the lobby wall, watching the entrance. For an hour, he paced between the lobby and Taylor’s room, until Maureen showed up. She and her son walked slowly toward each other and locked in a silent and almost motionless embrace.",255,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"When she let go, she addressed Taylor with near disbelief. “Thank you,” she said, over and over, softly.",256,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta borrowed her phone. He had a call to make.,257,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Ashley Volk was home in her kitchen in Chicago. She had been working graveyard shifts tending bar. She knew that Winter had been trying to get Siatta out but did not know about Chambers’s offer, or that a release was imminent. She saw Maureen’s number and answered.",258,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta’s voice was on the other end.,259,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“Love,” he said.",260,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“Oh my God!” she screamed. She fell against the kitchen cupboard and then to the floor, where she curled up, sobbing. Through the phone she could hear Siatta. He was crying, too.",261,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The next day, I met Chambers in a coffee shop. Everyone was surprised by the state’s abrupt change in position. There was a question to explore: Why did Chambers propose exactly the resolution to the case that his office had resisted for two years?",262,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Chambers described a criminal-justice system that resembled an overworked mill. His office handles almost 5,000 cases a year, he said, and it was not possible for him to follow each of them closely, much less read all the case materials. In Siatta’s case, he said, the journal that illuminated his combat history was not available during the plea-negotiation phase. It showed up just before trial.",263,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After we met the first time that spring, he said, he reviewed the file and found the journal. By the time he was done reading, he said, he was not surprised Siatta had ended up in handcuffs. “You take a 19-year-old and you put them in this extreme situation where they are being asked to do things — or maybe not asked, but are choosing to do things — that are contrary to the values they had growing up, and the U.S. government pats your back and says, ‘Good luck,’?” he said. “I don’t see how that is not a recipe for something to go wrong.”",264,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"From his point of view, Chambers said, the plea deal in the works was not actually a large shift. Siatta had received the minimum sentence for a Class-X felony and would soon plead to more than the minimum sentence for a felony one class down. “From a practical standpoint, it is a big change,” he said, because Siatta was out of prison. “From a legal standpoint, it is a hair’s width apart.”",265,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"And for society, Chambers added, the new arrangement was probably safer. If Siatta were to behave well in Shawnee, he would be eligible for release in less than three years and would return with virtually no counseling or care for his PTSD. Now Siatta would be under state supervision for several years, receiving care throughout. “The rationale for me became, ‘What makes people safer over the long term?’?” he said. “Is it treatment or just getting him off the street?”",266,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The man who had fought Siatta in the house in Normal found that his feelings had changed, too. Though he himself did not serve in combat, the Marine Corps remained central to his life. He served four years as a clerk and was honorably discharged as a noncommissioned officer. G.I. Bill benefits helped underwrite his college studies, and his brother was on active duty. Having been sequestered as a witness during the trial, he did not hear details of Siatta’s combat tour until January, at sentencing, and as he learned more he came to see Siatta as a drunken Marine who did something stupid. The home invasion was not personal. “At the end of the day, it was just a random act,” he said. When Chambers called him in the late spring to discuss vacating Siatta’s conviction, he listened to the prosecutor’s new proposal. After he thought about it, he told me: “I wasn’t angry anymore. I was ready to put it past me and to forgive.”",267,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After talking with Volk on the phone to tell her he had been released, Siatta went with his brother to a Target to replace his prison sneakers. Whether it was the sudden change from Shawnee to the big box store or the effect of the food, caffeine and nicotine he had consumed, he was overwhelmed. He vomited. The next day he registered with the bond office in Bloomington, and in the summer he appeared in court and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, attempted home invasion, and began four years of probation with weekly counseling at the V.A.",268,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He felt sluggish. He did little more in the first weeks than visit Volk and go to the gym. “His energy level was way down,” she said. Volk was struggling as well. The months Siatta spent in Shawnee, Volk said, had passed for her in gray procession. Every day was tasteless and colorless. But she understood that Siatta had it worse. Now that he was back, she was patient, willing to let therapy have its effects and allowing him to set his own pace. She was thrilled by his shift in fortune — “when I saw him, it was like being reborn,” she said — but was not expecting a fairy tale. When he seemed withdrawn, she invited him to walk. “We took the dogs around the block,” she said. “The next time, we walked a few more blocks.”",269,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By the fall, Siatta was making his appointments, in good standing with his probation officer and going out more. He was physically fit. The V.A. reduced his disability rating from 70 percent to 50 percent — a shift suggesting that doctors there felt his PTSD had less of a hold on him. When I visited him in late November, we ate three meals together in restaurants over four days. Each time he was amiable with the staff and did not appear vigilant. Twice he sat with his back to the door. He had not had a drink in almost two and a half years. His eyes seemed bright, his voice light, his demeanor relaxed. He was also looking for a job, although it was hard as a felon on probation to get past a background check. He was almost hired by a moving company, he said, until he told the supervisor of his conviction. He had not given up. Volk thought she might soon have something lined up for him to check IDs at the door of the sports bar where she worked.",270,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"While he waited, he was splitting time between his mother’s home and Volk’s place, and speaking of marriage. Volk knew where he had been and what he had done, and she accepted it all. Familiarity, Siatta suggested, was relief. “Explaining is exhausting,” he said, “and we’ve got most of it done.”",271,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"One morning after meeting his probation officer, Siatta was in the basement of his mother’s house, hitting a heavy bag. Upstairs in a scrapbook were photographs of his life, including one taken days before he left home for the Marines, when his recruiter had brought the family a cake. He was a shy kid with acne and muscular arms, able to do 28 pull-ups even before arriving at boot camp. He did not look much older now, in the basement, working the hanging bag. He had wrapped his hands with tape. His legs and feet were bare. Sweat beaded on his shoulders. The air carried the smack of each impact, followed by a pause. He was striking the bag steadily, resisting the urge to acknowledge the sharp pulsating in his hands as he tried to build pain tolerance and toughen his fists. “You don’t want to break your hand on someone’s face,” he said.",272,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was training to make an amateur mixed-martial-arts fight card and break into the Midwestern club-fighting scene. His regimen included sparring with a police-officer friend. He had only one problem so far. He lacked full control of his left arm. The stab wounds, it seemed, had caused nerve damage. He jabbed the bag with his left hand — thwack — and frowned. “It feels off, my hand-eye coordination, almost like my targeting system has been severed,” he said.",273,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I asked him whether entering the ring with one good arm to exchange blows with a trained fighter carried more risks than he might want, especially considering the delicate platinum coils in his neck that could be dislodged. He seemed tired of the question. It was the type of discouragement he had heard since telling friends he was enlisting in the Marines. “If my dream was to be a lawyer or doctor, something that was socially acceptable, then everybody would be happy,” he said. “But when I tell people I want to be a fighter, they are like, ‘Ooh, you’re going to fuck yourself.’?”",274,2017
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"People warn him that he is going to get hurt, he said, and “I’m like, ‘Well, it is fighting, so that’s almost a definite.’?” He hoped to earn enough money to pay the hospital bills. Hands throbbing, face blank, his left-side targeting system not quite right, Sam Siatta hit the bag.",275,2017
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"When the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck Tohoku, Japan, Chris Goldfinger was two hundred miles away, in the city of Kashiwa, at an international meeting on seismology. As the shaking started, everyone in the room began to laugh. Earthquakes are common in Japan—that one was the third of the week—and the participants were, after all, at a seismology conference. Then everyone in the room checked the time.",1,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Seismologists know that how long an earthquake lasts is a decent proxy for its magnitude. The 1989 earthquake in Loma Prieta, California, which killed sixty-three people and caused six billion dollars’ worth of damage, lasted about fifteen seconds and had a magnitude of 6.9. A thirty-second earthquake generally has a magnitude in the mid-sevens. A minute-long quake is in the high sevens, a two-minute quake has entered the eights, and a three-minute quake is in the high eights. By four minutes, an earthquake has hit magnitude 9.0.",2,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"When Goldfinger looked at his watch, it was quarter to three. The conference was wrapping up for the day. He was thinking about sushi. The speaker at the lectern was wondering if he should carry on with his talk. The earthquake was not particularly strong. Then it ticked past the sixty-second mark, making it longer than the others that week. The shaking intensified. The seats in the conference room were small plastic desks with wheels. Goldfinger, who is tall and solidly built, thought, No way am I crouching under one of those for cover. At a minute and a half, everyone in the room got up and went outside.",3,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"It was March. There was a chill in the air, and snow flurries, but no snow on the ground. Nor, from the feel of it, was there ground on the ground. The earth snapped and popped and rippled. It was, Goldfinger thought, like driving through rocky terrain in a vehicle with no shocks, if both the vehicle and the terrain were also on a raft in high seas. The quake passed the two-minute mark. The trees, still hung with the previous autumn’s dead leaves, were making a strange rattling sound. The flagpole atop the building he and his colleagues had just vacated was whipping through an arc of forty degrees. The building itself was base-isolated, a seismic-safety technology in which the body of a structure rests on movable bearings rather than directly on its foundation. Goldfinger lurched over to take a look. The base was lurching, too, back and forth a foot at a time, digging a trench in the yard. He thought better of it, and lurched away. His watch swept past the three-minute mark and kept going.",4,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Oh, shit, Goldfinger thought, although not in dread, at first: in amazement. For decades, seismologists had believed that Japan could not experience an earthquake stronger than magnitude 8.4. In 2005, however, at a conference in Hokudan, a Japanese geologist named Yasutaka Ikeda had argued that the nation should expect a magnitude 9.0 in the near future—with catastrophic consequences, because Japan’s famous earthquake-and-tsunami preparedness, including the height of its sea walls, was based on incorrect science. The presentation was met with polite applause and thereafter largely ignored. Now, Goldfinger realized as the shaking hit the four-minute mark, the planet was proving the Japanese Cassandra right.",5,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"For a moment, that was pretty cool: a real-time revolution in earthquake science. Almost immediately, though, it became extremely uncool, because Goldfinger and every other seismologist standing outside in Kashiwa knew what was coming. One of them pulled out a cell phone and started streaming videos from the Japanese broadcasting station NHK, shot by helicopters that had flown out to sea soon after the shaking started. Thirty minutes after Goldfinger first stepped outside, he watched the tsunami roll in, in real time, on a two-inch screen.",6,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In the end, the magnitude-9.0 Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed more than eighteen thousand people, devastated northeast Japan, triggered the meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, and cost an estimated two hundred and twenty billion dollars. The shaking earlier in the week turned out to be the foreshocks of the largest earthquake in the nation’s recorded history. But for Chris Goldfinger, a paleoseismologist at Oregon State University and one of the world’s leading experts on a little-known fault line, the main quake was itself a kind of foreshock: a preview of another earthquake still to come.",7,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Most people in the United States know just one fault line by name: the San Andreas, which runs nearly the length of California and is perpetually rumored to be on the verge of unleashing “the big one.” That rumor is misleading, no matter what the San Andreas ever does. Every fault line has an upper limit to its potency, determined by its length and width, and by how far it can slip. For the San Andreas, one of the most extensively studied and best understood fault lines in the world, that upper limit is roughly an 8.2—a powerful earthquake, but, because the Richter scale is logarithmic, only six per cent as strong as the 2011 event in Japan.",8,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Just north of the San Andreas, however, lies another fault line. Known as the Cascadia subduction zone, it runs for seven hundred miles off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, beginning near Cape Mendocino, California, continuing along Oregon and Washington, and terminating around Vancouver Island, Canada. The “Cascadia” part of its name comes from the Cascade Range, a chain of volcanic mountains that follow the same course a hundred or so miles inland. The “subduction zone” part refers to a region of the planet where one tectonic plate is sliding underneath (subducting) another. Tectonic plates are those slabs of mantle and crust that, in their epochs-long drift, rearrange the earth’s continents and oceans. Most of the time, their movement is slow, harmless, and all but undetectable. Occasionally, at the borders where they meet, it is not.",9,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Take your hands and hold them palms down, middle fingertips touching. Your right hand represents the North American tectonic plate, which bears on its back, among other things, our entire continent, from One World Trade Center to the Space Needle, in Seattle. Your left hand represents an oceanic plate called Juan de Fuca, ninety thousand square miles in size. The place where they meet is the Cascadia subduction zone. Now slide your left hand under your right one. That is what the Juan de Fuca plate is doing: slipping steadily beneath North America. When you try it, your right hand will slide up your left arm, as if you were pushing up your sleeve. That is what North America is not doing. It is stuck, wedged tight against the surface of the other plate.",10,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Without moving your hands, curl your right knuckles up, so that they point toward the ceiling. Under pressure from Juan de Fuca, the stuck edge of North America is bulging upward and compressing eastward, at the rate of, respectively, three to four millimetres and thirty to forty millimetres a year. It can do so for quite some time, because, as continent stuff goes, it is young, made of rock that is still relatively elastic. (Rocks, like us, get stiffer as they age.) But it cannot do so indefinitely. There is a backstop—the craton, that ancient unbudgeable mass at the center of the continent—and, sooner or later, North America will rebound like a spring. If, on that occasion, only the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone gives way—your first two fingers, say—the magnitude of the resulting quake will be somewhere between 8.0 and 8.6. That’s the big one. If the entire zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2. That’s the very big one.",11,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Flick your right fingers outward, forcefully, so that your hand flattens back down again. When the next very big earthquake hits, the northwest edge of the continent, from California to Canada and the continental shelf to the Cascades, will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a hundred feet to the west—losing, within minutes, all the elevation and compression it has gained over centuries. Some of that shift will take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of seawater. (Watch what your fingertips do when you flatten your hand.) The water will surge upward into a huge hill, then promptly collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other side will rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will reach the Northwest coast, on average, fifteen minutes after the earthquake begins. By the time the shaking has ceased and the tsunami has receded, the region will be unrecognizable. Kenneth Murphy, who directs FEMA’s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, “Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.”",12,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In the Pacific Northwest, the area of impact will cover* some hundred and forty thousand square miles, including Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Eugene, Salem (the capital city of Oregon), Olympia (the capital of Washington), and some seven million people. When the next full-margin rupture happens, that region will suffer the worst natural disaster in the history of North America. Roughly three thousand people died in San Francisco’s 1906 earthquake. Almost two thousand died in Hurricane Katrina. Almost three hundred died in Hurricane Sandy. FEMA projects that nearly thirteen thousand people will die in the Cascadia earthquake and tsunami. Another twenty-seven thousand will be injured, and the agency expects that it will need to provide shelter for a million displaced people, and food and water for another two and a half million. “This is one time that I’m hoping all the science is wrong, and it won’t happen for another thousand years,” Murphy says.",13,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In fact, the science is robust, and one of the chief scientists behind it is Chris Goldfinger. Thanks to work done by him and his colleagues, we now know that the odds of the big Cascadia earthquake happening in the next fifty years are roughly one in three. The odds of the very big one are roughly one in ten. Even those numbers do not fully reflect the danger—or, more to the point, how unprepared the Pacific Northwest is to face it. The truly worrisome figures in this story are these: Thirty years ago, no one knew that the Cascadia subduction zone had ever produced a major earthquake. Forty-five years ago, no one even knew it existed.",14,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"May of 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, together with their Corps of Discovery, set off from St. Louis on America’s first official cross-country expedition. Eighteen months later, they reached the Pacific Ocean and made camp near the present-day town of Astoria, Oregon. The United States was, at the time, twenty-nine years old. Canada was not yet a country. The continent’s far expanses were so unknown to its white explorers that Thomas Jefferson, who commissioned the journey, thought that the men would come across woolly mammoths. Native Americans had lived in the Northwest for millennia, but they had no written language, and the many things to which the arriving Europeans subjected them did not include seismological inquiries. The newcomers took the land they encountered at face value, and at face value it was a find: vast, cheap, temperate, fertile, and, to all appearances, remarkably benign.",15,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"A century and a half elapsed before anyone had any inkling that the Pacific Northwest was not a quiet place but a place in a long period of quiet. It took another fifty years to uncover and interpret the region’s seismic history. Geology, as even geologists will tell you, is not normally the sexiest of disciplines; it hunkers down with earthly stuff while the glory accrues to the human and the cosmic—to genetics, neuroscience, physics. But, sooner or later, every field has its field day, and the discovery of the Cascadia subduction zone stands as one of the greatest scientific detective stories of our time.",16,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The first clue came from geography. Almost all of the world’s most powerful earthquakes occur in the Ring of Fire, the volcanically and seismically volatile swath of the Pacific that runs from New Zealand up through Indonesia and Japan, across the ocean to Alaska, and down the west coast of the Americas to Chile. Japan, 2011, magnitude 9.0; Indonesia, 2004, magnitude 9.1; Alaska, 1964, magnitude 9.2; Chile, 1960, magnitude 9.5—not until the late nineteen-sixties, with the rise of the theory of plate tectonics, could geologists explain this pattern. The Ring of Fire, it turns out, is really a ring of subduction zones. Nearly all the earthquakes in the region are caused by continental plates getting stuck on oceanic plates—as North America is stuck on Juan de Fuca—and then getting abruptly unstuck. And nearly all the volcanoes are caused by the oceanic plates sliding deep beneath the continental ones, eventually reaching temperatures and pressures so extreme that they melt the rock above them.",17,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The Pacific Northwest sits squarely within the Ring of Fire. Off its coast, an oceanic plate is slipping beneath a continental one. Inland, the Cascade volcanoes mark the line where, far below, the Juan de Fuca plate is heating up and melting everything above it. In other words, the Cascadia subduction zone has, as Goldfinger put it, “all the right anatomical parts.” Yet not once in recorded history has it caused a major earthquake—or, for that matter, any quake to speak of. By contrast, other subduction zones produce major earthquakes occasionally and minor ones all the time: magnitude 5.0, magnitude 4.0, magnitude why are the neighbors moving their sofa at midnight. You can scarcely spend a week in Japan without feeling this sort of earthquake. You can spend a lifetime in many parts of the Northwest—several, in fact, if you had them to spend—and not feel so much as a quiver. The question facing geologists in the nineteen-seventies was whether the Cascadia subduction zone had ever broken its eerie silence.",18,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In the late nineteen-eighties, Brian Atwater, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, and a graduate student named David Yamaguchi found the answer, and another major clue in the Cascadia puzzle. Their discovery is best illustrated in a place called the ghost forest, a grove of western red cedars on the banks of the Copalis River, near the Washington coast. When I paddled out to it last summer, with Atwater and Yamaguchi, it was easy to see how it got its name. The cedars are spread out across a low salt marsh on a wide northern bend in the river, long dead but still standing. Leafless, branchless, barkless, they are reduced to their trunks and worn to a smooth silver-gray, as if they had always carried their own tombstones inside them.",19,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"What killed the trees in the ghost forest was saltwater. It had long been assumed that they died slowly, as the sea level around them gradually rose and submerged their roots. But, by 1987, Atwater, who had found in soil layers evidence of sudden land subsidence along the Washington coast, suspected that that was backward—that the trees had died quickly when the ground beneath them plummeted. To find out, he teamed up with Yamaguchi, a specialist in dendrochronology, the study of growth-ring patterns in trees. Yamaguchi took samples of the cedars and found that they had died simultaneously: in tree after tree, the final rings dated to the summer of 1699. Since trees do not grow in the winter, he and Atwater concluded that sometime between August of 1699 and May of 1700 an earthquake had caused the land to drop and killed the cedars. That time frame predated by more than a hundred years the written history of the Pacific Northwest—and so, by rights, the detective story should have ended there.",20,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"But it did not. If you travel five thousand miles due west from the ghost forest, you reach the northeast coast of Japan. As the events of 2011 made clear, that coast is vulnerable to tsunamis, and the Japanese have kept track of them since at least 599 A.D. In that fourteen-hundred-year history, one incident has long stood out for its strangeness. On the eighth day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of the Genroku era, a six-hundred-mile-long wave struck the coast, levelling homes, breaching a castle moat, and causing an accident at sea. The Japanese understood that tsunamis were the result of earthquakes, yet no one felt the ground shake before the Genroku event. The wave had no discernible origin. When scientists began studying it, they called it an orphan tsunami.",21,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Finally, in a 1996 article in Nature, a seismologist named Kenji Satake and three colleagues, drawing on the work of Atwater and Yamaguchi, matched that orphan to its parent—and thereby filled in the blanks in the Cascadia story with uncanny specificity. At approximately nine o’ clock at night on January 26, 1700, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck the Pacific Northwest, causing sudden land subsidence, drowning coastal forests, and, out in the ocean, lifting up a wave half the length of a continent. It took roughly fifteen minutes for the Eastern half of that wave to strike the Northwest coast. It took ten hours for the other half to cross the ocean. It reached Japan on January 27, 1700: by the local calendar, the eighth day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of Genroku.",22,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Once scientists had reconstructed the 1700 earthquake, certain previously overlooked accounts also came to seem like clues. In 1964, Chief Louis Nookmis, of the Huu-ay-aht First Nation, in British Columbia, told a story, passed down through seven generations, about the eradication of Vancouver Island’s Pachena Bay people. “I think it was at nighttime that the land shook,” Nookmis recalled. According to another tribal history, “They sank at once, were all drowned; not one survived.” A hundred years earlier, Billy Balch, a leader of the Makah tribe, recounted a similar story. Before his own time, he said, all the water had receded from Washington State’s Neah Bay, then suddenly poured back in, inundating the entire region. Those who survived later found canoes hanging from the trees. In a 2005 study, Ruth Ludwin, then a seismologist at the University of Washington, together with nine colleagues, collected and analyzed Native American reports of earthquakes and saltwater floods. Some of those reports contained enough information to estimate a date range for the events they described. On average, the midpoint of that range was 1701.",23,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"It does not speak well of European-Americans that such stories counted as evidence for a proposition only after that proposition had been proved. Still, the reconstruction of the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 is one of those rare natural puzzles whose pieces fit together as tectonic plates do not: perfectly. It is wonderful science. It was wonderful for science. And it was terrible news for the millions of inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest. As Goldfinger put it, “In the late eighties and early nineties, the paradigm shifted to ‘uh-oh.’ ”",24,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Goldfinger told me this in his lab at Oregon State, a low prefab building that a passing English major might reasonably mistake for the maintenance department. Inside the lab is a walk-in freezer. Inside the freezer are floor-to-ceiling racks filled with cryptically labelled tubes, four inches in diameter and five feet long. Each tube contains a core sample of the seafloor. Each sample contains the history, written in seafloorese, of the past ten thousand years. During subduction-zone earthquakes, torrents of land rush off the continental slope, leaving a permanent deposit on the bottom of the ocean. By counting the number and the size of deposits in each sample, then comparing their extent and consistency along the length of the Cascadia subduction zone, Goldfinger and his colleagues were able to determine how much of the zone has ruptured, how often, and how drastically.",25,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Thanks to that work, we now know that the Pacific Northwest has experienced forty-one subduction-zone earthquakes in the past ten thousand years. If you divide ten thousand by forty-one, you get two hundred and forty-three, which is Cascadia’s recurrence interval: the average amount of time that elapses between earthquakes. That timespan is dangerous both because it is too long—long enough for us to unwittingly build an entire civilization on top of our continent’s worst fault line—and because it is not long enough. Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a two-hundred-and-forty-three-year cycle.",26,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"It is possible to quibble with that number. Recurrence intervals are averages, and averages are tricky: ten is the average of nine and eleven, but also of eighteen and two. It is not possible, however, to dispute the scale of the problem. The devastation in Japan in 2011 was the result of a discrepancy between what the best science predicted and what the region was prepared to withstand. The same will hold true in the Pacific Northwest—but here the discrepancy is enormous. “The science part is fun,” Goldfinger says. “And I love doing it. But the gap between what we know and what we should do about it is getting bigger and bigger, and the action really needs to turn to responding. Otherwise, we’re going to be hammered. I’ve been through one of these massive earthquakes in the most seismically prepared nation on earth. If that was Portland”—Goldfinger finished the sentence with a shake of his head before he finished it with words. “Let’s just say I would rather not be here.”",27,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The first sign that the Cascadia earthquake has begun will be a compressional wave, radiating outward from the fault line. Compressional waves are fast-moving, high-frequency waves, audible to dogs and certain other animals but experienced by humans only as a sudden jolt. They are not very harmful, but they are potentially very useful, since they travel fast enough to be detected by sensors thirty to ninety seconds ahead of other seismic waves. That is enough time for earthquake early-warning systems, such as those in use throughout Japan, to automatically perform a variety of lifesaving functions: shutting down railways and power plants, opening elevators and firehouse doors, alerting hospitals to halt surgeries, and triggering alarms so that the general public can take cover. The Pacific Northwest has no early-warning system. When the Cascadia earthquake begins, there will be, instead, a cacophony of barking dogs and a long, suspended, what-was-that moment before the surface waves arrive. Surface waves are slower, lower-frequency waves that move the ground both up and down and side to side: the shaking, starting in earnest.",28,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Soon after that shaking begins, the electrical grid will fail, likely everywhere west of the Cascades and possibly well beyond. If it happens at night, the ensuing catastrophe will unfold in darkness. In theory, those who are at home when it hits should be safest; it is easy and relatively inexpensive to seismically safeguard a private dwelling. But, lulled into nonchalance by their seemingly benign environment, most people in the Pacific Northwest have not done so. That nonchalance will shatter instantly. So will everything made of glass. Anything indoors and unsecured will lurch across the floor or come crashing down: bookshelves, lamps, computers, cannisters of flour in the pantry. Refrigerators will walk out of kitchens, unplugging themselves and toppling over. Water heaters will fall and smash interior gas lines. Houses that are not bolted to their foundations will slide off—or, rather, they will stay put, obeying inertia, while the foundations, together with the rest of the Northwest, jolt westward. Unmoored on the undulating ground, the homes will begin to collapse.",29,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Across the region, other, larger structures will also start to fail. Until 1974, the state of Oregon had no seismic code, and few places in the Pacific Northwest had one appropriate to a magnitude-9.0 earthquake until 1994. The vast majority of buildings in the region were constructed before then. Ian Madin, who directs the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI), estimates that seventy-five per cent of all structures in the state are not designed to withstand a major Cascadia quake. FEMA calculates that, across the region, something on the order of a million buildings—more than three thousand of them schools—will collapse or be compromised in the earthquake. So will half of all highway bridges, fifteen of the seventeen bridges spanning Portland’s two rivers, and two-thirds of railways and airports; also, one-third of all fire stations, half of all police stations, and two-thirds of all hospitals.",30,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Certain disasters stem from many small problems conspiring to cause one very large problem. For want of a nail, the war was lost; for fifteen independently insignificant errors, the jetliner was lost. Subduction-zone earthquakes operate on the opposite principle: one enormous problem causes many other enormous problems. The shaking from the Cascadia quake will set off landslides throughout the region—up to thirty thousand of them in Seattle alone, the city’s emergency-management office estimates. It will also induce a process called liquefaction, whereby seemingly solid ground starts behaving like a liquid, to the detriment of anything on top of it. Fifteen per cent of Seattle is built on liquefiable land, including seventeen day-care centers and the homes of some thirty-four thousand five hundred people. So is Oregon’s critical energy-infrastructure hub, a six-mile stretch of Portland through which flows ninety per cent of the state’s liquid fuel and which houses everything from electrical substations to natural-gas terminals. Together, the sloshing, sliding, and shaking will trigger fires, flooding, pipe failures, dam breaches, and hazardous-material spills. Any one of these second-order disasters could swamp the original earthquake in terms of cost, damage, or casualties—and one of them definitely will. Four to six minutes after the dogs start barking, the shaking will subside. For another few minutes, the region, upended, will continue to fall apart on its own. Then the wave will arrive, and the real destruction will begin.",31,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Among natural disasters, tsunamis may be the closest to being completely unsurvivable. The only likely way to outlive one is not to be there when it happens: to steer clear of the vulnerable area in the first place, or get yourself to high ground as fast as possible. For the seventy-one thousand people who live in Cascadia’s inundation zone, that will mean evacuating in the narrow window after one disaster ends and before another begins. They will be notified to do so only by the earthquake itself—“a vibrate-alert system,” Kevin Cupples, the city planner for the town of Seaside, Oregon, jokes—and they are urged to leave on foot, since the earthquake will render roads impassable. Depending on location, they will have between ten and thirty minutes to get out. That time line does not allow for finding a flashlight, tending to an earthquake injury, hesitating amid the ruins of a home, searching for loved ones, or being a Good Samaritan. “When that tsunami is coming, you run,” Jay Wilson, the chair of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission (OSSPAC), says. “You protect yourself, you don’t turn around, you don’t go back to save anybody. You run for your life.”",32,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The time to save people from a tsunami is before it happens, but the region has not yet taken serious steps toward doing so. Hotels and businesses are not required to post evacuation routes or to provide employees with evacuation training. In Oregon, it has been illegal since 1995 to build hospitals, schools, firehouses, and police stations in the inundation zone, but those which are already in it can stay, and any other new construction is permissible: energy facilities, hotels, retirement homes. In those cases, builders are required only to consult with DOGAMI about evacuation plans. “So you come in and sit down,” Ian Madin says. “And I say, ‘That’s a stupid idea.’ And you say, ‘Thanks. Now we’ve consulted.’ ”",33,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"These lax safety policies guarantee that many people inside the inundation zone will not get out. Twenty-two per cent of Oregon’s coastal population is sixty-five or older. Twenty-nine per cent of the state’s population is disabled, and that figure rises in many coastal counties. “We can’t save them,” Kevin Cupples says. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it and say, ‘Oh, yeah, we’ll go around and check on the elderly.’ No. We won’t.” Nor will anyone save the tourists. Washington State Park properties within the inundation zone see an average of seventeen thousand and twenty-nine guests a day. Madin estimates that up to a hundred and fifty thousand people visit Oregon’s beaches on summer weekends. “Most of them won’t have a clue as to how to evacuate,” he says. “And the beaches are the hardest place to evacuate from.”",34,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Those who cannot get out of the inundation zone under their own power will quickly be overtaken by a greater one. A grown man is knocked over by ankle-deep water moving at 6.7 miles an hour. The tsunami will be moving more than twice that fast when it arrives. Its height will vary with the contours of the coast, from twenty feet to more than a hundred feet. It will not look like a Hokusai-style wave, rising up from the surface of the sea and breaking from above. It will look like the whole ocean, elevated, overtaking land. Nor will it be made only of water—not once it reaches the shore. It will be a five-story deluge of pickup trucks and doorframes and cinder blocks and fishing boats and utility poles and everything else that once constituted the coastal towns of the Pacific Northwest.",35,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"To see the full scale of the devastation when that tsunami recedes, you would need to be in the international space station. The inundation zone will be scoured of structures from California to Canada. The earthquake will have wrought its worst havoc west of the Cascades but caused damage as far away as Sacramento, California—as distant from the worst-hit areas as Fort Wayne, Indiana, is from New York. FEMA expects to coördinate search-and-rescue operations across a hundred thousand square miles and in the waters off four hundred and fifty-three miles of coastline. As for casualties: the figures I cited earlier—twenty-seven thousand injured, almost thirteen thousand dead—are based on the agency’s official planning scenario, which has the earthquake striking at 9:41 A.M. on February 6th. If, instead, it strikes in the summer, when the beaches are full, those numbers could be off by a horrifying margin.",36,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Wineglasses, antique vases, Humpty Dumpty, hip bones, hearts: what breaks quickly generally mends slowly, if at all. OSSPAC estimates that in the I-5 corridor it will take between one and three months after the earthquake to restore electricity, a month to a year to restore drinking water and sewer service, six months to a year to restore major highways, and eighteen months to restore health-care facilities. On the coast, those numbers go up. Whoever chooses or has no choice but to stay there will spend three to six months without electricity, one to three years without drinking water and sewage systems, and three or more years without hospitals. Those estimates do not apply to the tsunami-inundation zone, which will remain all but uninhabitable for years.",37,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"How much all this will cost is anyone’s guess; FEMA puts every number on its relief-and-recovery plan except a price. But whatever the ultimate figure—and even though U.S. taxpayers will cover seventy-five to a hundred per cent of the damage, as happens in declared disasters—the economy of the Pacific Northwest will collapse. Crippled by a lack of basic services, businesses will fail or move away. Many residents will flee as well. OSSPAC predicts a mass-displacement event and a long-term population downturn. Chris Goldfinger didn’t want to be there when it happened. But, by many metrics, it will be as bad or worse to be there afterward.",38,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"On the face of it, earthquakes seem to present us with problems of space: the way we live along fault lines, in brick buildings, in homes made valuable by their proximity to the sea. But, covertly, they also present us with problems of time. The earth is 4.5 billion years old, but we are a young species, relatively speaking, with an average individual allotment of three score years and ten. The brevity of our lives breeds a kind of temporal parochialism—an ignorance of or an indifference to those planetary gears which turn more slowly than our own.",39,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"This problem is bidirectional. The Cascadia subduction zone remained hidden from us for so long because we could not see deep enough into the past. It poses a danger to us today because we have not thought deeply enough about the future. That is no longer a problem of information; we now understand very well what the Cascadia fault line will someday do. Nor is it a problem of imagination. If you are so inclined, you can watch an earthquake destroy much of the West Coast this summer in Brad Peyton’s “San Andreas,” while, in neighboring theatres, the world threatens to succumb to Armageddon by other means: viruses, robots, resource scarcity, zombies, aliens, plague. As those movies attest, we excel at imagining future scenarios, including awful ones. But such apocalyptic visions are a form of escapism, not a moral summons, and still less a plan of action. Where we stumble is in conjuring up grim futures in a way that helps to avert them.",40,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"That problem is not specific to earthquakes, of course. The Cascadia situation, a calamity in its own right, is also a parable for this age of ecological reckoning, and the questions it raises are ones that we all now face. How should a society respond to a looming crisis of uncertain timing but of catastrophic proportions? How can it begin to right itself when its entire infrastructure and culture developed in a way that leaves it profoundly vulnerable to natural disaster?",41,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The last person I met with in the Pacific Northwest was Doug Dougherty, the superintendent of schools for Seaside, which lies almost entirely within the tsunami-inundation zone. Of the four schools that Dougherty oversees, with a total student population of sixteen hundred, one is relatively safe. The others sit five to fifteen feet above sea level. When the tsunami comes, they will be as much as forty-five feet below it.",42,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In 2009, Dougherty told me, he found some land for sale outside the inundation zone, and proposed building a new K-12 campus there. Four years later, to foot the hundred-and-twenty-eight-million-dollar bill, the district put up a bond measure. The tax increase for residents amounted to two dollars and sixteen cents per thousand dollars of property value. The measure failed by sixty-two per cent. Dougherty tried seeking help from Oregon’s congressional delegation but came up empty. The state makes money available for seismic upgrades, but buildings within the inundation zone cannot apply. At present, all Dougherty can do is make sure that his students know how to evacuate.",43,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Some of them, however, will not be able to do so. At an elementary school in the community of Gearhart, the children will be trapped. “They can’t make it out from that school,” Dougherty said. “They have no place to go.” On one side lies the ocean; on the other, a wide, roadless bog. When the tsunami comes, the only place to go in Gearhart is a small ridge just behind the school. At its tallest, it is forty-five feet high—lower than the expected wave in a full-margin earthquake. For now, the route to the ridge is marked by signs that say “Temporary Tsunami Assembly Area.” I asked Dougherty about the state’s long-range plan. “There is no long-range plan,” he said.",44,2016
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Dougherty’s office is deep inside the inundation zone, a few blocks from the beach. All day long, just out of sight, the ocean rises up and collapses, spilling foamy overlapping ovals onto the shore. Eighty miles farther out, ten thousand feet below the surface of the sea, the hand of a geological clock is somewhere in its slow sweep. All across the region, seismologists are looking at their watches, wondering how long we have, and what we will do, before geological time catches up to our own.",45,2016

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"But powder and people are key ingredients for avalanches.

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It’s a cultural shift, where more skiers are going farther, faster, bigger,” said John Stifter, the editor of Powder magazine, who was a part of the group at Tunnel Creek in February. “Which is tending to push your pro skiers or other experienced, elite-level backcountry skiers that much farther, faster and bigger, to the point where there’s no margin for error.”",35,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,No one knows how many avalanches occur. Most naturally triggered slides are never seen. Those set off by humans are rarely reported unless they cause fatalities or property damage.,36,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"But avalanches occur in Tunnel Creek regularly. Its slopes, mostly from 40 to 45 degrees, are optimal for avalanches — flat enough to hold deep reservoirs of snow, yet steep enough for the snow to slide long distances when prompted. The long elevation drop means snow can be fluffy at the top and slushy at the bottom. Temperatures, wind and precipitation change quickly, and something as welcome as a burst of sunshine can alter the crystallized bonds deep inside the snow. And because Tunnel Creek is outside the ski area, it is not patrolled or specifically assessed for danger.",37,2013

In Washington, there’s a saying: If you don’t like the weather, wait five minutes. And it’s true.

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Mark Moore, director and lead meteorologist of the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center, had set that day’s forecast on Saturday afternoon. A 64-year-old with graying hair pulled into a short ponytail, Moore had a feeling it could be a busy weekend.",89,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The avalanche center, based in Seattle, is one of about 20 regional avalanche forecasting centers in the United States, most run by the Forest Service. During the winter, one of its three employees arrives in the middle of the night, analyzes weather maps and computer models, and examines data — snowfall, temperatures, wind, humidity and so on — from 47 remote weather stations scattered across the mountains, including five in the vicinity of Stevens Pass. They take calls from ski patrollers and highway crews.",90,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The biggest storm of the season increased avalanche concerns. But it was not just the new snow that concerned Moore. It was what lay nearly three feet beneath — a thin layer of perfectly preserved frost called surface hoar. The frozen equivalent of dew, created on crisp, clear nights, it features fragile, featherlike crystals that grow skyward.",91,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"On the surface, they glimmer like a million tiny diamonds. When frosted and protected by soft blankets of fluffy snow, they are weak stilts supporting all that falls on top. When they finally give way, falling like microscopic dominoes on a steep slope, they provide an icy flume for the snow above.",92,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"A shot of rain or above-freezing temperatures, both common in Cascade winters, usually destroy the fragile crystals, melding them into the snowpack. But five days of dry, cold weather, from Feb. 3 to 7, created a perfect, sparkly layer of surface hoar. Sporadic light snow, never more than an inch or two a day, delicately shrouded it over the next 10 days.",93,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Changes in temperatures, precipitation, humidity and wind can turn a benign snowpack into a deadly one, and vice versa. Sometimes weather is enough to start an avalanche. But “natural” avalanches rarely kill.

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Snowboards have borrowed from skis, too. Some models can be quickly split into two pieces, allowing users to stride up short hills in pursuit of bigger descents.",177,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Similar advances in safety gear, such as easy-to-use digital beacons and air bags, have helped make the backcountry feel less dangerous. Beacons help rescuers find people buried under the snow, while air bags deploy a large balloon meant to help keep the skier closer to the surface of an avalanche. A leading American manufacturer of safety gear is named, appropriately, Backcountry Access.",178,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Companies, including Salomon and Flylow, have marketed heavily to ride the backcountry trend. They are keenly aware that many buyers will never ski the backcountry but want to dress the part.",179,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Those marketing shifts have coincided with a generation raised on the glorification of risk. From X Games to YouTube videos, helmet cameras to social media, the culture rewards vicarious thrills and video one-upmanship. This generation no longer automatically adheres to the axiom of waiting a day for safer conditions. The relative placidness of inbounds skiing is no match for the greater adventure of untamed terrain.",180,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Among avalanche forecasters and the growing cottage industry of safety instructors, there is pride in noting that the number of fatalities has risen at a slower rate than the number of backcountry users. But they see themselves as part of a difficult race between the coming hordes and the tools to protect them.",181,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“You could argue that skiers have never been this educated or safe,” Stifter, the Powder magazine editor, said. “There’s been a huge emergence and emphasis on avalanche classes. Then you also have this lifesaving technology. But if you go to Jackson or Utah, you’ll see people who are not educated, who are just going out there because they see it in the movies and they see it in magazines like Powder: there’s fresh tracks and, man, it looks like fun.”",182,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"At the top of Seventh Heaven, the members of the group took off their skis and snowboards. Directly to the right of the lift’s unloading ramp was a narrow trail that disappeared up through a clog of trees.",183,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Read this,” one sign read in all capital letters. “Ski Area Boundary. Minimum of $1000.00 rescue fee! Do you have a partner, beacon, probe and shovel? Explosives may be used in this area at any time. Continue at your own risk.”",184,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"While there are no laws dictating what equipment people carry into the backcountry, there is a code. Carry a beacon (for sending and receiving signals), a probe (for poking for victims in the snow) and a shovel (for digging them out).",188,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“When you go in the backcountry, you’re trusting your life in the hands of everybody else and they’re trusting their life in you,” Michelson said. “If I get buried and my ski partner doesn’t have a beacon, shovel or probe, it’s my life on the line.”",189,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"One member of the party did not elicit a beep: Erin Dessert, a 35-year-old snowboarder who was early for her afternoon shift as a Stevens Pass lift operator. Wesley invited her along. She thought everyone was riding off the front side of Cowboy Mountain, back into the ski area.",190,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The group marched single file along the narrow ridge for a few minutes until it reached a wider area to convene. Tracks dropped back over a steep edge and into the ski area to the left.,191,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It was about 11:45. The storm had passed. A low, pewter sky hid the surrounding peaks. Castillo glanced around at the others, wearing helmets and rainbow hues, a kaleidoscope of color amid the gray surroundings, like sprinkles on vanilla ice cream.",195,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"There was loose banter and a few casual introductions. Not everyone met everyone else. Someone pulled out marijuana to smoke, and passed it.",197,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Wesley, the snowboarder known as Tall Tim, saw the size of the assembled group. More than a dozen, he thought.",198,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“That never happens,” he said. “And it’s basically the legends of Stevens Pass standing up there.”",199,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"There was little doubt that those with Tunnel Creek experience knew the way. About half the group had been down dozens of times each, if not hundreds. The others would follow.",200,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"There was no broad discussion of the route down. Pockets of the group talked about staying left, not being too greedy by going too far down the meadow before cutting across.",201,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“That run, it’s not that it’s supersteep, or there are cliffs, or that it’s a really rowdy run,” Carlson, one of the Stevens Pass regulars, said. “It’s that if anything goes wrong, it’s a terrain trap. If somebody happens to set off even a slough slide and you’re below them in Tunnel, it all bottlenecks and really adds up superfast. That’s the reason that run is heavy. It’s notorious.”",202,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Unspoken anxiety spread among those unfamiliar with the descent. The mere size of the group spooked some. Backcountry users of all types — skiers, snowboarders, snowmobilers and climbers — worry about how much of a load a slope can absorb before it gives way. They worry about people above them causing an avalanche. When it comes to the backcountry, there is usually not safety in large numbers.",203,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"That is not only because of the physical impact on the snow. It is because of the complicated dynamics that large groups create. Deadly avalanches are usually the product of bad decisions — human nature, not Mother Nature.",204,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“If it was up to me, I would never have gone backcountry skiing with 12 people,” Michelson, the ESPN journalist, said. “That’s just way too many. But there were sort of the social dynamics of that — where I didn’t want to be the one to say, you know, ‘Hey, this is too big a group and we shouldn’t be doing this.’ I was invited by someone else, so I didn’t want to stand up and cause a fuss. And not to play the gender card, but there were 2 girls and 10 guys, and I didn’t want to be the whiny female figure, you know? So I just followed along.”",205,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Others suppressed reservations, too.",206,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“The whole thing felt rushed to me, and it felt kind of like this covert operation,” Stifter said. “Which it kind of was, because you’re going out of bounds. It’s obviously acceptable, especially when you’re going out there with all these locals and the director of marketing. It’s not illegal or anything. It just had this rushed feeling from the time Chris walked out of the office, and he’s like, ‘All right, let’s go.’”",207,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Carlsen, Stifter’s Powder colleague, was uneasy. He tried to convince himself that it was a good idea.",208,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“There’s no way this entire group can make a decision that isn’t smart,” he said to himself. “Of course it’s fine, if we’re all going. It’s got to be fine.”",209,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"After a few minutes, the small talk faded. Worries went unexpressed.",210,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“When you’re up on top of a peak like that, it’s usually hang out for a second, and then it’s momentum,” Castillo said. “You just kind of feel it. Everyone’s like: ‘O.K., we’re not here to hang out. Let’s start going.’ So I saw people starting to slide, get going, and I was like: ‘Hey, Johnny, partner up. Buddy system. Let’s go. Me and you.’ And at that point, it clicked. Everyone’s like, yeah, partners, partners, partners.”",211,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It is a tenet of avalanche safety, and the command snapped the group to attention.",212,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Someone said, ‘Partner up — everyone should grab a partner,’” Carlsen said. “Immediately I thought, We’re in a somewhat serious situation. It wasn’t just grab a partner so you don’t get lost. It was grab a partner so you. ...",213,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“It just felt bigger all of a sudden.”,214,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Rudolph, the Stevens Pass marketing director, teamed with Saugstad, the professional skier.",215,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I was really excited about that,” Saugstad said, “because he’s just such a cool guy and I thought, wow, cool, he wants to be my partner. A very trustworthy guy that’s an amazing skier.”",216,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Jack, on borrowed Salomon skis, paired with Joel Hammond, the Salomon representative. Carlson looked at Pankey, his childhood friend.",217,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Dude, you’re coming with me,” he said.",218,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Wesley gave a little whistle to Carlson and Pankey and nodded downhill. He wanted to be first. The conditions were too good to waste time, and he did not want to be slowed by the huge pack.",219,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"With little warning, Wesley dropped straight through the large cluster of trees, using firs as a slalom course. Pankey and Carlson followed.",220,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Rudolph, always up for competition, sped around the trees, not through them. He curved around a banked C-shape turn that dropped him a couple hundred feet into the broad meadow below.",221,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"He arrived just in time to see Wesley, Pankey and Carlson burst from the trees into the open powder. Rudolph pointed his ski poles and playfully shouted invectives as their tracks crossed.",222,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Wesley laughed, and his two friends followed him left and over a small rise.",223,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Rudolph headed straight down the mountain.,224,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I remember looking back at where he was going and being confused,” Wesley said. “Like, ‘Where is he going?’”",225,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,All the locals in the group presumed they knew what the others were thinking. They did not.,226,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“When you know an avalanche is not very likely, that’s a great way to go,” Wesley said of Rudolph’s choice to ski straight down farther. “It’s three open glades of awesome powder.”",227,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Earlier that morning, Wesley and Carlson had skied the opposite side of Cowboy Mountain, in the ski area. It had been cleared of avalanches by the ski patrol at dawn, but the two still triggered several slough slides — small, shallow avalanches that washed at their feet and petered out before snagging victims.",228,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“That’s why, when they said we’re doing Tunnel, I was like, ‘Ooh, dicey,’” Wesley said.",229,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Pankey and Carlson followed Wesley and looked back, too, wondering why Rudolph and the others were not following them toward relatively safer terrain. Within a minute, long enough to be well out of sight of the group they left behind, the three men found something that made them stop.",230,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We were right on top of a knoll, a little rollover, where we were about to make some really fun turns, and we saw that the face had already slid,” Carlson said. “It was pretty large.”",231,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Alarmed, the three decided to go farther left. They crossed through trees and avoided big meadows and steep pitches. They soon found evidence of another avalanche, this one cutting through the forest.",232,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I’d really never seen anything slide in the trees like that,” Carlson said. “And that was definitely like: ‘Holy cow, we shouldn’t be back here, Ron. Let’s go left. Let’s go hard left.’”",233,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Wesley had disappeared in the pale light. He left nothing but a track through the deep snow that the others tried to follow.,234,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Rudolph stopped on the left edge of the upper meadow, above a cluster of trees. Others filed behind him, spilling down the mountain in plumes of spraying snow.",236,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Erin Dessert did not follow. She was confused. She was once a Tunnel Creek regular, until a nonfatal avalanche captured five friends in 2002 and scared her away.",237,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Chris Rudolph’s, like, totally all about safety protocol and mountain awareness and wisdom,” she said. “That guy knows the conditions like an animal. He has instincts. It didn’t register, even for a second, that he might be bringing this group to Tunnel Creek. It wasn’t logical. I thought we were doing the front side.”",238,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"She headed hard to the right, away from the others. The other snowboarders that she knew, Carlson and Wesley, were gone in the opposite direction. Some in the remaining group noticed Dessert heading away in the distance and dismissed her as an oblivious backcountry rookie. She dipped out of sight in a lonely panic.",239,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I’ve been riding Stevens Pass since I was 3 years old,” Dessert said. “I can tell circumstances, and I just felt like something besides myself was in charge.

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Rudolph and the others, now a group of 12, were focused downhill. It was 11:52 a.m. Rudolph did not wait for the back of the pack to arrive before continuing to demonstrate the way.",241,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“So Chris Rudolph went first, and then he pulled into the trees and we waited for a sec,” said Castillo, who was near the front of the group, wearing a helmet camera. “He goes out of sight and behind the trees. So I said, ‘O.K., Megan, go ahead, spoon those tracks, and you’ll see Chris on the left.’”",242,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Saugstad traced through the knee-deep snow just to the right of Rudolph’s elongated S-shape tracks. She dipped through trees at a pinch in the meadow and disappeared out of sight. She crossed over Rudolph’s tracks and giggled. After about 30 seconds, she was back at Rudolph’s side, having cut left into a notch of the trees again.",245,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We skied to an area that was probably about 500 feet down or so from where we started,” Saugstad said. “And where we skied to was an area of old-growth trees.

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"But just before he stopped, Castillo was jolted by a weird sensation.",250,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“A little pang, like, ooh, this is a pretty heavy day out here,” Castillo said. “Thing’s holding, but I remember having a feeling.”",251,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Castillo stopped above two trees. He nestled close and pushed his right ski tight against them.,252,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"His helmet camera showed that 14 seconds after Castillo stopped, Brenan appeared through the trees above Rudolph and Saugstad. Brenan had hugged the tree line on the left, avoiding the open meadow, then slalomed through the patch that the others used for protection. He stopped in a spray of snow a few feet from Rudolph and Saugstad.",254,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“That was sick!” someone shouted.,255,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Castillo silently took note of the terrain.,256,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I was downhill from them — skier’s right from them,” Castillo said. “But the trees that they were behind, I didn’t think it was a bad spot to stop. They were huge. Giant old-growths that three of us probably can’t put our hands around.”",257,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"But he knew the direction of the slope did not follow the meadow. It dipped harder left into the trees, down toward a gully. And there were still a lot of skiers above them.",258,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Saugstad was next to Rudolph. Brenan was a few feet away.,259,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We weren’t straight across from each other, in a perfect horizontal line on the slope,” Saugstad said. “We were peppered up and down, spread out.”",260,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Castillo kept his attention up the hill. Less than 30 seconds after Brenan stopped, he saw Tim Wangencut through the trees above the earlier arrivals, gliding horizontally through the forest. Wangen had been taught how to navigate Tunnel Creek by his father. He knew that the farther down the mountain he went, the harder it would be to cut over the ridge and into the next big meadow. He crossed the shallow gully and rose up the other side.",261,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I could see the others when I cut over,” Wangen said. “I thought: Oh yeah, that’s a bad place to be. That’s a bad place to be with that many people. But I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to be the jerk.”",262,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Wangen had told Peikert to follow his tracks, and Peikert was close behind. Castillo watched where they went.",263,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“Want to cut over?” Castillo shouted to those above him.,264,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The start of an avalanche is unlike any other force of nature.,265,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,A hurricane is foretold by wind and lashing waves. A tornado often is spotted before it strikes. Lightning is usually presaged by black clouds and rumbling thunder.,266,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Avalanches rarely provide such a warning. Unlike waves or wind, tremors or storms, they are usually triggered by their own victims, sometimes unaware of what has been unleashed.",267,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Back up the mountain, Jack never seemed worried. That was his nature. Here he was, a rare weekend off, skiing with some of his best friends from Leavenworth and people from Powder and ESPN and all over the industry, on an epic run on a perfect powder day.",269,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Carlsen, the Powder photographer, had never been to Tunnel Creek. The first few easy turns gave way to a slope that fell steeply away, out of sight. He sidled up to Jack.",270,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I grabbed him, and I said, ‘What is the move here?’” Carlsen said. “It was basically like, ‘This is getting real, how do we handle it?’ He’s like: ‘Oh, no big deal. We go out here, swing out, make a few pow turns, and get back in the trees.’ I looked at him and said, ‘Have a great run.’ Gave him a fist, a knuckle-to-knuckle high-five thing. And that was it. I watched him swing out, way out, skier’s right, and then dive into his turn left.”",271,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Jack flowed through the thick powder with his typical ease. He skied the way other people walked down a sidewalk, a friend had said.",272,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“He looked like he was having a great time, the run of his life, in fact,” Michelson said. “And he actually made, I remember, a little ‘woo’ sound, as he dropped in on his first or second turn because the snow was really good. It was deep and light.”",274,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Then the snow changed without warning.,275,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The five others listened. Not a sound. They stared for clues through the flat light below a murky sky. Nothing.,279,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Silent seconds ticked. Finally, Hammond spotted the first sign of evidence. It came from a tree, one among thousands, far down the hill, almost out of sight. Only the top of it was visible, and it was covered in snow.",280,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I saw it moving,” Hammond said. “Like something had hit the tree, and it shook. And I could see the powder falling off the tree.”",281,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I saw it,” Saugstad said. “I saw it coming. But it was weird because it was coming through the trees. It was like snow billowing through the trees. Because it was such a treed area, I think for the first second I saw it I didn’t believe it.”",283,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Wangen and Peikert had just traversed in front of its path. It did not miss them by much.,284,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I don’t know if I’d even come to a stop when I heard it,” Peikert said. “It was almost like wind and pressure more than noise. It literally felt like a freight train went over my tails. It wasn’t a deep rumble. I could feel this rush of air.”",285,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It was a blur of white, its shattered pieces moving about 50 m.p.h., a powder cloud two stories tall.",286,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I had no ability to control what was happening to me,” Saugstad said. “I was being tossed over and over and over. It was like being in a washing machine and all my body parts flailing every way. I didn’t know which way was up. I didn’t know which way was down. I couldn’t see anything.”",291,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"She is likely to have tumbled just past Castillo. He groaned and turned his face away. He stuck his head between two trees, like a prisoner in a stockade.",292,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"For 16 seconds, snow and ice pounded his back and washed over him. His shoulders were jammed against the trees. His face pushed into branches of pine needles. He could feel the heavy assault of snow lashing at his back.",293,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Trees cracked around him. Some in the path were chopped in half — the stumps left in the soil, the rest carried away in the growing torrent.",294,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The avalanche, a relatively small one, started with about 6,000 cubic meters of snow and collected 7,000 cubic meters more on the way down. It probably weighed about 11 million pounds.",295,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The trees Castillo hugged in each arm swayed but held. He told himself that when he felt the flow slow, he would pop a hand in the air so that it might stick out of the snow and make him easier to rescue.",296,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Just as I had the thought about what I’m going to do, wondering if it was going to bury me, that’s right when I could feel it,” Castillo said. “It was like a wave. Like when you’re in the ocean and the tide moves away from you. You’re getting thrashed and you feel it pull out and you’re like, O.K., I can stand up now.”",297,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Castillo saw daylight again. His camera captured snow sliding past his legs for another 13 seconds. The forest sounded as if it were full of sickly frogs. It was the trees, scrubbed of their fresh snow, still swaying and creaking around him.",298,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Castillo turned to look back up the hill.,299,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Where there were three people, there was nobody,” Castillo said.",300,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"He did not know who or what set off the avalanche. He did not know how far down the mountain it went. All he knew was that about a dozen people had been above him a minute earlier, and that the gully below him descended another 2,000 vertical feet to the valley floor.",301,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,And he was alone.,302,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Johnny! Johnny Brenan!” Castillo screamed into the stillness, his voice escalating with panic. The scope of the disaster was too much to comprehend. He wanted to find his partner.",303,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“So I’m screaming his name,” Castillo said. “I’m screaming and screaming. Silence.”",304,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Streams of snow still flowed downhill as he scooted toward the heart of the slide path. It flowed into a wide gully, maybe 100 feet across, that narrowed as it descended. Castillo turned his beacon to “search” mode, meaning he would receive signals of those buried, but would not emit signals himself.",305,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I don’t want to be in this gully because I don’t know what’s coming down next,” Castillo said. “I don’t want to be the next guy taken out. Now I don’t even have a beacon on because I’m on search. They’re not going to find me if anything happens to me.”",306,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Across the gully, unable to see anyone else, either, Peikert and Wangen had gone into search mode, too.",307,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I was like, if there’s someone in that, the clock’s ticking,” Peikert said.",308,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Chances of survival drop precipitously every minute. According to a recent study, the survival rate for individuals completely buried in an avalanche falls to about 40 percent after 15 minutes of burial and to 25 percent after 30 minutes. About 75 percent of avalanche victims die from asphyxia or suffocation. The other 25 percent of fatalities result from trauma.",309,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Castillo spotted Peikert and Wangen across the gully. They, too, were nervous about hangfire, the unstable snow left along the edges of an avalanche’s path that can release at any moment.",310,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The avalanche had turned the gully into an oversize bobsled run, with slick, high-banked walls.",311,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“This gully’s hard-core!” Castillo yelled. “They’re in it!”,312,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Wangen stayed mostly on the banks. Peikert and Castillo crossed the gully a couple of times, reluctantly and quickly.",313,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“What’s your name again?” Castillo shouted at Peikert.,314,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It was soon apparent that the victims, however many there were, suffered one of two fates: they were hung up on the banks of the gully, snagged by a tree or buried in snow, or they had been flushed to the bottom, thousands of feet below.",315,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"If searchers spent too much time looking along the gully, they might squander a chance at rescuing someone at the bottom. If they rushed downhill, they might pass someone in need of saving.",316,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We started to ski down, hoping to find him in a tree well or hanging on or something,” said Castillo, his focus on Brenan. “But I started to realize all the trees were bent over, and I started thinking, this is really fricking bad. And then I skied down to a point where I found Johnny’s ski, probably three or four feet up in a tree. Stuck.”",317,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Castillo called 911. It was 12:02 p.m. The avalanche occurred seven minutes earlier.,318,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Hi, I’m at Stevens Pass resort, on the backside of Tunnel Creek,” Castillo told the King County Sheriff’s Department dispatcher. He added, “We had a major avalanche, and we might have three or four people missing, at least.”",319,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The dispatcher asked him to slow down. Castillo, occasionally shouting at others nearby, tried to explain where the avalanche occurred. He was asked how many people there were.",320,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“There’s at least 10,” Castillo said. “Between 10 and 12.”",321,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The dispatcher asked if anybody was hurt.,322,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We haven’t found them,” Castillo said. “I found one ski. It rolled through pretty heavy, man. I had partners right next to me and they’re missing. I just found a ski about 1,000 yards down. Or 1,000 feet down.”",323,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The call lasted four minutes. Castillo, carrying his friend’s ski, turned down the mountain.",324,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Near the top, the five skiers who planned to follow Jim Jack deciphered what happened through a series of increasingly blunt clues. Loose snow. A shaking tree.",325,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Hammond was due to ski next. He took a couple of turns through the fine powder of the meadow and stopped. There was a sudden drop, nearly three feet deep. The fluffy snow was gone. A surface of bluish ice stretched down the hill, into the trees and out of sight.",326,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Once I had gotten to the edge, I was like, oh my gosh, this thing ripped big,” Hammond said. “I could see the scope of it.”",327,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,He shouted for everyone to go into search mode. The other four skiers moved quickly to see.,328,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We all skied up to it and were like, holy smokes,” Stifter said. “From there all I remember was pulling out my phone. And I called Jim Jack.”",329,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Others started dialing numbers, too. They called Chris Rudolph and Elyse Saugstad. There were no answers. Hammond dropped onto the slick slide path. Another clue lay on the ice, pointing downhill.",330,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I hopped out there and made one or two turns, and I saw one of Jim’s skis,” Hammond said. “The only reason I recognized Jim’s skis was that it was a pair of skis that he borrowed from me.”",331,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The realization that Jack had been carried away was a gut punch.,332,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“In one respect, you’re like, oh no, a ski — where’s Jim?” Abrams said. “On the other hand, you think, O.K., there’s his ski. Let’s find him.”",333,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Michelson called 911. According to sheriff’s department records, it was 12:03 p.m.",334,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Her voice was steady and sure. She patiently tried to explain where they were — “The backside of the ski area in the backcountry,” she explained. “Tunnel Creek.”",335,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The dispatcher asked if people were buried.,336,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I believe so, yes,” Michelson replied. “I don’t know how many. We have a large group.”",337,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Word was relayed to the ski area. Chris Brixey, manager of the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol, had 17 patrollers working on the mountain that day, two more in the aid room, and a dispatcher. Brixey is a regular at Johnny Brenan’s Monday night poker parties. He did not know that a group of friends, including Rudolph, his Stevens Pass co-worker, had gone to Tunnel Creek.",338,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I happened to be walking through the aid room,” Brixey said. “Our dispatcher handed me a note that said 10 people are buried in Tunnel Creek. I called the 911 operator and got Megan’s information. I called Megan directly. She said there’s about 12 people and they were looking for eight people. I didn’t know Megan. My gut feeling was that this was a group of inexperienced people who are now dealing with tragedy.”",339,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Brixey called the area’s most seasoned patroller and put him in charge of the four-member first-response unit, called the hasty team, to follow the group’s trail. He also enlisted other patrollers and a pair of avalanche rescue dogs.",340,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Word of a large avalanche in Tunnel Creek soon echoed around Stevens Pass, from the patrol room to the R.V. lot, up the lifts and down the slopes. According to the Stevens Pass Ski Patrol log, the area closed public access to the boundary gate atop the Seventh Heaven lift at 12:19.",341,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"By then, the group that had started off together less than 30 minutes earlier was strewn up and down nearly 3,000 vertical feet. No one knew how many were missing.",342,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Keith Carlsen was nearest the top, searching for Jack.",343,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I thought someone has to make sure he’s not still up here,” Carlsen said. “It wasn’t likely, but his ski was there, and he got swept, and there’s no sign of him, so maybe he got pummeled into the snow, into a hole, somewhere, right away.”",344,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The others headed down, scanning the path and its edges with their beacons. Carlsen methodically checked the upper meadow.",345,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I thought I was going to be the one to find him, and I would find him alone,” Carlsen said. “And the bed surface at the top was rock hard. And I’m thinking: I’m going to get a signal, and this guy’s going to be buried, and I’m going to have to somehow dig him out. I’m going to find Jim Jack.”",346,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Scared and alone, Carlsen’s voice broke the silence.",347,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I’m saying, and I remember repeating this in my head: ‘Jim, am I about to find you? Jim, are you underneath me? Jim, where the hell are you? Is this possible? Is he really underneath here? Am I about to dig Jim out?’”",348,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Farther down, others followed the path into the gully. As it descends toward the valley floor, it carves deeper into the mountain. In some spots, canyon walls are 20 feet high. There were steep, icy drops that would become gushing waterfalls during the spring runoff.",349,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“There are places it’s so tight that I would stop and my skis would straddle the middle,” Hammond said. “And I’d be elevated, like being on springs.”",350,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It was still clogged with rocks and trees that had not been fully scoured away. Where the ravine bent, the avalanche rode high on the outside wall, like a child on a water slide, sometimes breaking over the top of the bank and unearthing trees on the ridges.",351,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It was fear,” Abrams said. “Fear that you lost someone, and fear that you’re standing in an avalanche path. You’re thinking, Don’t get caught up on trees, listen for the beacons, where’s my fiancée?”",352,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,It became increasingly evident that whoever was caught in the avalanche would be found at the bottom.,353,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I probably went down for one or two minutes and I got no signal,” Michelson said. “I shouted: ‘They’ve gone all the way down! The way this gully is, they’ve been flushed.’”",354,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Tim Carlson and Ron Pankey, having split from the big group at the top, nervously negotiated the roundabout route to the bottom of Tunnel Creek. They could not catch up to Tim Wesley, but followed his snowboard track to the valley floor. It was 12:07 p.m.",355,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"They glided past the foot of a mound of chunky debris. One of the ravines had spewed a sizable avalanche, but there was no way to know it had occurred in the past few minutes.",356,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I looked up and I saw a ski pole sticking up,” Carlson said. “It looked like someone stuck it in there. It was sticking up right at the very end of the pile. Handle up.”",357,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,He shouted to Pankey.,358,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I was like, ‘Dude, you need to turn your transceiver on,’” Carlson said. “‘There’s people in here.’”",359,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Carlson clicked out of his snowboard bindings and climbed onto the pile. Pankey turned his beacon to search mode. It beeped immediately.,360,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"His skis off, Pankey climbed onto the debris pile, too. He saw the ski pole and two gloves. He was sucker-punched by dread.",361,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“You figure someone who is fighting is going to have his gloves on,” Pankey said. “If they’re limp, yeah, their gloves are going to come off.”",362,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Then he noticed the brand.,363,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“That was my thought — Oh, God, those are Scott gloves. Jim Jack was wearing Scott gloves,” Pankey said.",364,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Their beacons shrieked.,365,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I probably searched for maybe a minute before I was on top of a signal,” Carlson said. “Your signal goes ‘beepbeepbeepbeepbeepBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP,’ and it gets a little fainter, like oh, over here. I got a strong signal, traversed over, got a weak signal, went back, got a strong signal, went back and I was basically on top of a body.",366,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“And, uh, the first shovel I dug in, I hit Jim Jack’s arm.”",367,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The two men dug frantically.,368,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I saw Jim Jack’s face,” Carlson said. “Eyes open, just staring at me. We could see he wasn’t breathing. Ron started giving him breaths and I was searching for his body, underneath his chest. I was like, ‘What the hell is going on?’ There was no body where you’d expect a body to be. And then I started digging around, and I could see he was folded up into this ball. His feet were above his head.”",369,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,His body had been pummeled.,370,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“There was no blood, but he didn’t have his helmet on, he didn’t have his backpack on, his jacket was pulled over his head,” Carlson said. “He had some scrapes on his belly. And just pulling him out of the snow you could feel it and see it. Giving him a couple of breaths, it just came out so quick. And you push on his chest and it would just collapse. There was nothing there. And Jim Jack — we’re all strong dudes, and there was just nothing left.”",371,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I pulled his arm upright, and it was just really soft,” Carlson added. “It was like pulling a wet towel. Pulled the other arm and it was the same feeling. And I pulled his legs out, and there was nothing connected to anything. It was completely crushed.”",372,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,They turned off Jack’s beacon and tried to lay him peacefully in the snow. Pankey pushed his eyelids closed.,373,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,He called 911 at 12:31 p.m. and told the dispatcher that he had “recovered a body.”,374,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,She asked him for his name.,375,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Jim Jack,” Pankey replied.",376,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Jack’s phone chirped. It had survived the avalanche, and Pankey reached into Jack’s pocket and pulled it out. It was a text message from Jack’s girlfriend, Tiffany Abraham. Rumors of a big avalanche in Tunnel Creek had reached the base area of Stevens Pass.",377,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“Where are you?” it read. “You OK?”,378,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Pankey looked over at the ski pole sticking straight out of the snow. It looked familiar. Pankey had noticed it on the hike up the ridge to Cowboy Mountain.,379,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“That’s the guy’s in front of me,” Pankey said. “He was hiking in front of me and Jim Jack was behind me, and he had these old Smith, corrective angle, curved poles. So I’m like, ‘That’s Johnny’s pole.’”",380,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"At the upper end of the meadow, more than 100 yards away and out of sight, Elyse Saugstad waited in the silence, unable to move.",381,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"She did not know how long she had been frozen there — head pointed downhill, hands sticking out of the snow, face poking through the ice just enough to breathe and see the breaking clouds trailing the weekend’s storm.",382,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Her hip ached. Her mind wandered. She wondered who else was caught in the avalanche. She wondered who was left to rescue them.,383,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"She felt herself getting colder. Her pink mittens, like those of a child’s, had strings that attached them to her jacket. When she had come to a stop, one of the mittens was on her hand. The other was off, hanging from her wrist.",384,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Saugstad could not claw the hard-packed snow with her mittens on. She took them off and picked at the ice until her fingers ached. She put her mittens on again until they warmed up.,385,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,She had not spoken since the avalanche stopped. It had not occurred to her to cry for help. Someone would come. She hoped.,386,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Finally, for the first time, she shouted.",387,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,“Help!” she screamed.,388,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The face of Wenzel Peikert startled her.,389,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Among those who skied down the gully, Peikert arrived first to the avalanche’s final resting place. The walls of the ravine slowly fell away and opened onto a wide, sloping meadow. It was covered by an enormous pile of chunky ice cubes, some fit for a cocktail glass, others the size of couches. The debris was filled with dirt, rocks and shredded tree parts.",390,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It stretched about 150 yards down what remained of the slope. It was 10 or 20 feet tall, obstructing Peikert’s view to the bottom. Peikert’s beacon began its frantic chirping.",391,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I started getting a signal,” Peikert said. “I marked it with one of my poles. That’s what they teach, to mark where you start picking up a signal and keep working to where it gets stronger. I took my skis off because it was so hard to ski on that stuff. And as I got close to that signal, I saw two pink gloves sticking out.”",392,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Saugstad was about 20 feet downhill.,393,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Her feet were into the snow and her head was downhill, but I saw two pink gloves and her face,” Peikert said. “I don’t know if she uncovered her face or not, but it was just barely sticking out of the snow. And a little bit of orange from her backpack. I started digging her out, trying not to hurt her. I said, ‘Are you O.K.?’ And she said: ‘I think so. My leg’s kind of hurt.’”",394,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Peikert pulled his shovel from his backpack and started to dig.,395,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“For a pause, really quickly, I thought to myself: she’s alive, she’s breathing, her face is out of the snow,” Peikert said. “I thought, let’s go find others. But then I realized that more snow could come down. I found someone alive, and I needed to get her out of here.”",396,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Saugstad sensed his urgency.,397,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“When he started unburying me, he flung his shovel and it went flying down the hill so far that he couldn’t stop and go get it,” she said. “And so then he had to start digging me out with his hands.”",398,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Peikert hurried, knowing that others were likely buried nearby.",399,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“She was actually really hard to get out,” he said. “One of her skis had stayed on, so it had kind of locked her into the snow. Even a ski boot gets locked in. I dug to get her ski off. It probably took five minutes of digging to get her out.”",400,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Finally, Michelson and Abrams arrived from above. They found Peikert and Saugstad on their feet.",401,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It didn’t dawn on me that she had been buried,” Michelson said. “I was relieved she was alive.”",402,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Over several minutes, others trickled down from above.",403,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Once we got to the bottom, when we got through the ravine and got to the mouth, I just remember saying, ‘Oh, my God,’” Stifter said. “Snow chunks the size of boulders. That’s when I realized the magnitude of everything. It looked like a war zone. It was chaos.”",404,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Michelson took charge as an impromptu site commander. No one was sure who was missing or how many victims there might be. Michelson used her beacon and pinpointed two spots for others to search, then continued sweeping the meadow to search for more.",405,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“My numbers and directions were bouncing all over the place,” Peikert said. “But Megan comes up and hers was right on it. Mine is a little bit older, but I don’t know why it was bouncing around. I started probing, and I hit a spot where there obviously was something other than snow.”",406,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Peikert and Rob Castillo dug through the ice. It had been more than 30 minutes since the avalanche.,407,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Johnny Brenan was discovered about three feet below the surface. He had been buried a few feet from Saugstad all along.,409,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I found his back first,” Peikert said. “His head was really bent under. I tried to dig a hole through his armpit, to his head, thinking I might be able to get his face turned to give him C.P.R. There was blood. His chin was split open. His helmet was pushed back onto the back of his head and was filled with snow. One leg was off in a weird position, like he had a broken femur or hip or something. I finally got him out. He was cold. Blue.”",410,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Castillo, Brenan’s longtime friend and ski partner, worked side by side with Peikert, at last getting his legs out.",411,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“The muscles were just beat,” Castillo said.",412,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"About 20 feet up the hill, Abrams, Wangen and Stifter zeroed in on a victim, too. It was the spot that Peikert had marked with his pole before he spotted Saugstad.",413,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“We were still searching for the lowest signal,” Stifter said. “And the lowest signal I got on the transceiver was 2.4, and it took me, like, half a second to realize, oh, that’s six feet down because it’s in meters. So I’m like, all right, this is our lowest reading. And I think on our third probe we struck something. I told Dan and Tim, ‘All right, get the shovels out,’ and we started digging.”",414,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Digging was nothing like scooping snow from a driveway. It was more like shoveling the chunky piles that snowplows leave along the side of a cleared highway, full of large pieces seemingly glued together.",415,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“They’re big mounds of snow and they’re like concrete,” Stifter said. “So you dig and dig, and then that person would rotate to the back and take a break and the guy who was second would start clearing snow out for the guy who is digging.”",416,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Quickly exhausted, they rotated frequently.",417,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It was just a bad dream,” Abrams said. “I was standing there holding my shovel that I never intended to use, except maybe to get my car out.”",418,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Finally, they reached a victim: Chris Rudolph.",419,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“He was lying facedown, so it was hard to get to his face,” Stifter said. “And it was hard because we couldn’t move him because he was just encased in there. His feet were buried really deeply. Finally I was able to get to his face. His face was blue. And so finally I was like: ‘We’ve got to get his feet out! We’ve got to get his feet out!’ That took another good couple of minutes to get his feet free. Then we gently pulled him out by his backpack.”",420,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Stifter performed C.P.R. on Rudolph: 2 breaths, 30 compressions, to the point of exhaustion.",421,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Saugstad called 911. It was 12:40 p.m.,422,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I’m reporting an avalanche,” she said, breathlessly.",423,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Frantic voices behind her shouted encouragement.,424,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Come on! You can do it! Come on, buddy! Take a breath!”",425,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The dispatcher said there were “units on scene.” Saugstad said they had not arrived and asked if they were coming by helicopter.,426,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Uh, we do not have a helicopter yet in the area because of the avalanche risk,” the dispatcher said.",427,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Hammond was the last to arrive from above and took over trying to revive Rudolph.,428,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I definitely believed that there was a chance,” Stifter said. “My hope dissipated certainly after Joel got there and I was sitting there. We knew. We looked at each other.”",429,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Twenty feet downhill, the huddle around Brenan slowly came to the same conclusion. Peikert had been performing C.P.R. for close to 30 minutes, with Castillo’s help.",430,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I was hoping for a miracle then,” Castillo said. “But I really kind of understood that he was probably dead.”",431,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"An hour’s worth of adrenaline dissolved to disheartened shock. A few other skiers had happened upon the scene, but no rescue help had arrived.",432,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Saugstad walked around dazed, wearing her deflated air bag “like dead angel wings,” Carlsen said. Castillo made his way to the bottom of the hill to learn that Jim Jack was dead, too. Erin Dessert, the snowboarder who had veered away from the group at the top, frightened by the direction everyone was headed, had cautiously made her way down and rediscovered the group. She cradled Rudolph’s head as others tried their last attempts to resuscitate him.",433,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It’s Chris Rudolph,” she said. “You know? He’s the knight in shining armor of Stevens Pass.”",434,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Laurie Brenan and Tiffany Abraham, Jack’s girlfriend, were both in the Bull’s Tooth Pub and Eatery, on the second level of the Granite Peaks Lodge.",435,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I saw Tiffany sitting at the bar, and I sat a few seats away,” Brenan said. “She says, ‘I haven’t seen Jim yet.’ And I said, ‘Oh, he and Johnny did Tunnel Creek.’”",436,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The man next to Abraham, a neighbor from Leavenworth, overheard. There was an avalanche in Tunnel Creek, he said. Someone came into the restaurant a while ago and asked for volunteers to help search.",437,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Abraham’s heart sank. Normally a font of buoyant optimism, she had a sudden pang of dread.",438,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I downed my cocktail because I knew I’d need it,” Abraham said. “The bartender was telling a story, and I was trying to be polite and listen, but I knew I had to get out of there. I got my lunch boxed up and walked down to the ski patrol office. I took the elevator, and it was the slowest elevator in the world.”",439,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,She could tell immediately that bad news was waiting. She spotted a friend who was on his way to the scene.,440,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“He grabs my hand and I screamed at him,” Abraham said. “‘What the hell is going on?’”",441,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"They went into the ski patrol room, on the ground level on the backside of the lodge. Inside is a first-aid room with beds for injured skiers. Beyond is a ski patrol break room, a couch against one wall.",442,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Anne Hessburg, Rudolph’s girlfriend, was sitting there, balled up in tears. She had skied all morning with a friend and taken an early lunch at the Iron Goat pizzeria. She walked up to the slope-side cabin that Rudolph had provided to the journalists from Powder magazine. Hessburg stored skis there. A friend received a call while she was there.",443,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Someone told him there was an avalanche in Tunnel Creek,” Hessburg said. “He told me, and my stomach immediately dropped.”",444,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Hessburg rushed to the ski patrol room. She could tell by the way people were moving that it was something serious. She could hear the squawks on the walkie-talkies. Someone told her only that Rudolph was probably involved, as if to break the emotional fall.",445,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Brixey, the ski patrol manager, confirmed it. Rudolph was dead. That was about when Abraham walked into the patrol room with her friend, noticing a broken Hessburg on the couch.",446,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Abraham’s friend turned to her, looked her in the eyes, and told her about Jack.",447,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Baby girl, he’s gone,” he said.",448,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I just lost my breath,” Abraham said. “I lost it. I couldn’t even be in my skin.”",449,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Laurie Brenan had no premonition. She watched Abraham rush out of the restaurant at the news of an avalanche and casually followed a few minutes behind.,450,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I thought everything was fine,” she said. “But I’m going over to ski patrol. I felt like Johnny was probably using his skills, digging somebody out.”",451,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,She tried to stay out of the way as people hurried in and out of the patrol room.,452,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Then I heard someone say something about Jim Jack, and I thought, oh my God, how can that be?” Brenan said. “I knew they were all in the same group. I start calling to see if I can get someone to get my kids safe, back to the R.V., and get them a snack and put on a movie or something.”",453,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Brenan spotted Brixey, the patrol manager and Monday night poker player, and waited for an opening to approach.",454,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I said, ‘So, Chris, there’s been an avalanche in Tunnel Creek?’” Brenan said. “And he said yes. Anyone hurt? He said yes. Is anyone dead? He said yes. And I said, ‘Do I know these people?’ And he said yes. I said, ‘Where’s Johnny?’ And he said, ‘I haven’t heard.’”",455,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It was true. One 911 call from Tunnel Creek had reported the death of Jack. Another had reported the death of Rudolph. A third made mention of a third fatality, but the dispatcher never asked the name. Brixey did not learn about Brenan until his own patrol members reached the scene.",456,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I went outside, totally shaking,” Laurie Brenan said. “I kept dropping my water bottle, again and again, because I was shaking so much. Then Chris Brixey comes and gets me.”",457,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Brixey’s outward calm belied the turmoil inside. As a paramedic, he had told a lot of strangers that a loved one had died. But never a close friend.",458,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“That was, by far, the biggest challenge for me, walking Laurie from outside back to my office,” Brixey said. “Not knowing what I was going to say, but knowing what I had to say.”",459,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"They walked past the empty beds, past Hessburg on the couch, past Abraham. In the office, he turned to her.",460,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“He said Johnny was one of the people buried,” Brenan said. “‘He didn’t make it.’ I didn’t want to believe it. I said, ‘Have you seen him?’ He said no. I said: ‘Then you don’t know. It’s possible he’s not there. You go back and get more information because that is wrong. Go. Go find him. You’re wrong.’ I remember thinking: He’s got two kids. This was for fun. Johnny doesn’t leave his responsibilities. Ever.”",461,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Brixey left. Brenan melted into shock. Finally, a friend from Leavenworth came in. He had gone to Tunnel Creek about 20 minutes behind the large group and happened upon the scene.",462,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“He said, ‘I can tell you it was him,’” Laurie Brenan said. “‘I gave him C.P.R. We tried.’",463,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It really felt like I had died then,” Brenan said. “And that I was reborn into a nightmare.”",464,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Back on the other side of Cowboy Mountain, and down a meadow that had been turned inside out, weary huddles surrounded three dead men.",465,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,Hope had surrendered. Rescues became grim vigils. The survivors did not know what to do other than wait. The bodies and faces of the victims were covered in jackets because it seemed the respectful thing to do. Survivors introduced themselves to those they had not met.,466,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"A group of 16 skiers and snowboarders, all of them experts, all of them unable to refuse the temptation of an hourlong excursion into steep powder, had been reduced by three lives.",467,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“I’m so done with it,” Stifter thought to himself. “I’m so done with skiing.”",468,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The first ski patrollers, along with an avalanche dog named Cava, arrived at 1:05 p.m., 70 minutes after the mountain gave way. They had started at the top and combed the entire path, following the funnel from the wide upper meadow through the flumelike ravine, searching for victims along the way. By the time they spit out of the mouth at the bottom, there was no rescue to be done.",469,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The patrollers recognized faces in the huddles. They realized then that they had been searching for friends, not strangers. They stopped to find Rudolph and Brenan. Another patroller headed farther down to learn about Jack.",470,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"More patrollers began to arrive from below, on snowmobiles brought from the highway. A scene of quiet contemplation buzzed with activity and a second wave of despair.",471,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“It just became this sea, getting merged into everybody else’s shock,” Dessert said. “When it was just us out there working on them, it seemed beautiful and spiritual, almost like an Indian burial ground.”",472,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,The patrollers tried to revive the victims. It was useless.,473,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"A medical examiner determined that Jack’s cause of death was “subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage” — brain trauma. She also diagnosed a partially torn aorta; a broken neck, vertebrae, sternum and ribs; and lacerations of the liver, spleen and pancreas. She described “blunt force injury of the head, neck, torso and extremities.”",474,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Rudolph, with a “blunt force injury of the torso,” sustained “rib fractures with right hemothorax and probably compressional asphyxia.” Brenan had “blunt force injury and compression of the trunk,” with “multiple rib and vertebral fractures with probable compressional asphyxia.”",475,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"They were probably dead by the time the avalanche stopped, or shortly after.",476,2013

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"The survivors were encouraged to make their way to the highway, where ambulances awaited. Saugstad, missing a ski, used the one of Jack’s that had been found. Hammond had been carrying it on his back.",478,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Stifter and Carlsen sat on the meadow, unable to pull themselves away.",479,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"“Everybody kind of skied down,” Stifter said. “It seemed weird to me to leave the bodies.”",480,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"As with other survivors, the quarrel with their own guilt began immediately, the first sign that avalanches swallow more lives than just the ones buried beneath the snow.",481,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"They wondered if their mere presence at Stevens Pass that weekend gave rise to the Tunnel Creek trip, a group of proud locals eager to show off for influential out-of-towners. They wondered why they recognized all of the danger signs, starting with the avalanche report that morning over coffee, but did not do enough to slow or stop the expedition. They wondered if they could have saved lives after the avalanche by speeding to the bottom rather than combing the path.",482,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"They wondered how so many smart, experienced people could make the types of decisions that turned complex, rich, enviable lives into a growing stack of statistics.",483,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Activity disturbed the quiet again. A Sno-Cat, a large machine with treads to climb through snow-covered terrain, rumbled through the trees below and parked at the bottom of the debris pile. Ski patrollers solemnly marched up the hill, carrying gear to wrap the bodies.",484,2013
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"It was one deadly avalanche accident among many, perhaps no more worthy of attention than any other. It was not the nation’s deadliest avalanche of the season.

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The prosecutor wanted to know about window coverings. He asked: Which windows in the house on South Rose Street, the house where you woke up to him standing over you with a knife that night— which windows had curtains that blocked out the rest of the world and which did not?",2,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"She answered the prosecutor’s questions, pointing to a map of the small South Park home she used to share with her partner, Teresa Butz, a downtown Seattle property manager. When the two of them lived in this house, it was red, a bit run-down, much loved, filled with their lives together, typical of the neighborhood. Now it was a two-dimensional schematic, State’s Exhibit 2, set on an easel next to the witness stand. She narrated with a red laser pointer for the prosecutor and the jury: These windows had curtains that couldn’t be seen through. These windows had just a sheer fabric.",3,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Would your silhouettes have been visible through that sheer fabric at night?,4,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Probably. She didn’t know for sure. When she and her partner lived in the house, she noted, “I didn’t spend a lot of time staring in my own windows.”",5,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Everyone in the courtroom laughed a small laugh—a laugh of nervous relief, because here was a woman testifying about her own rape, and the rape and murder of her partner, and yet she was smiling at the current line of questioning, at the weird perceptual cul-de-sac to which it led. She appeared to understand why people might need to hear these answers, though. What happened to her and Butz in that house in the early morning hours of July 19, 2009, is hard to comprehend. A juror, in order to ease into the reality of what occurred, might first need to imagine how the man picked these two women. At least, then, there’d be some sort of arc to the story.",6,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Maybe he stalked them, looked in their windows, decided they would be his victims. A young South Park girl named Diana Ramirez had already told the court that the man looked familiar. “His eyes,” Ramirez said. The prosecutor had also pointed out that the women only had a partial fence in their backyard, the yard where they liked to sit on warm evenings, staring at the sky above the South Park Community Center and the trees in the large surrounding park. It would have been easy for the man to approach their home, unseen, through this park at night.",7,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Maybe he’d noticed the women around the neighborhood during the day, both attractive, both shorter than him, working in their front yard, or attending a local festival, or heading to and from their favorite bar, Loretta’s. That July it was unusually hot. Butz, a brown-haired dynamo raised in much hotter St. Louis summers, thought it ridiculous to install air conditioning in Seattle, the court was told. Maybe the man saw that these women were keeping some windows open at night.",8,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Maybe he also saw their love for each other, noticed it in silhouette or on a sidewalk, a love that was exploding that summer, making them inseparable, a love that had grown into plans for a commitment ceremony that fall. Maybe he realized he could turn that love against them, mercilessly, use it to control them in their own home, each subdued by the threat that he would kill the other.",9,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"They were two and he was one. But maybe he saw that, in a sense, they were one. He was six feet tall, 200 pounds, muscled. He would have two knives with him. Maybe, looking through one of their windows, he thought that if it did become a fight, the numbers would be on his side.",10,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"She understood, sitting up there on the witness stand, why people might need to imagine her window coverings. But this is not what the survivor of the South Park rapes and murder had come to talk about. The mechanics, both psychological and practical, of how the attacks might have come to pass were now well beside the point. In any sense that would satisfy, they are probably unknowable.",11,2012

You must listen. This happened to us. You must hear who was lost. You must hear what he did. You must hear how Teresa fought him. You must hear what I loved about her.

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The woman, now 38—out of respect for her wishes, The Stranger is not publishing her name—held the room with a transfixing emotional frankness. She cried at times. She set her jaw and pressed on when it got exhausting, the reliving of an ordeal that probably lasted around 90 minutes, but took close to six hours over two days to retell in court. She showed regret and terror and humiliation and grief and fury. She showed that she appreciated how awful, really absurdly awful, this all was, and she welcomed opportunities to laugh—at herself, at odd things her murdered partner had done when she was alive, at an inelegant, unintentionally impolite question from the prosecuting attorney about a trip she’d made to Weight Watchers with her partner on their last morning together as part of the couple’s plan to get in better shape before their commitment ceremony.",13,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The prosecuting attorney asked something like: How’d it go at Weight Watchers? Without missing a beat, without shame, she framed her body with her hands, moved them up and down, and said: “Well…”",14,2012

Laugh at the awkwardness of this, as everyone in the courtroom is doing right now, if that’s what you all need to do. It’s okay. Really. Look at me. And thank you for looking, because later on in this trial, the prosecutor will step up to the witness stand and pull my straight black hair back from my neck so that I can more easily point out, for all of you who are looking, the four slashing scars that run from below my left ear toward my throat, the scars from when the man cut and stabbed me with his knife. I am not scared. I have nothing to hide here. Not anymore. Not for something as important as this, the opportunity to put him away.",15,2012

And she had this dream of owning a cafe-slash-movie theater. She wanted to call it the Reel Cafe. We were talking about it, what it would mean, what it would take… We came to this decision that we would work at our corporate jobs for as long as it took to make that happen, and then she would do that.”",18,2012

Butz stopped at a store along the way and got her brand of beer, Bud Light. She wasn’t a regular smoker, but she was craving a cigarette. She said she was going to buy just one. They sat in the backyard of the little red house, staring at the trees, the community center, the sky above. “It was really hot that night,” Butz’s partner recalled on the stand. “Probably like in the 80s or 90s.” They drank. Butz, it turned out, had come away from the store with three or four cigarettes. She smoked them all.",23,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“It was just one of those nights,” her partner said. “I remember thinking: ‘In this moment, my life may not be perfect, but I am so happy.’”",24,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The next day was Saturday, July 18, 2009. Weight Watchers in the morning. Then a fun thing a friend had gotten them into: a double-decker bus tour of microbreweries in the South Park area. Butz played bartender on the bus. A friend took pictures of them together. “I remember the sun was shining,” her partner said. “It was really hot. And I remember a few times I glanced at Teresa, and she had her face up. She loved the sun. She was in heaven.”",25,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"There was a late-afternoon trip to a dressmaker who was working on a commitment ceremony gown for Butz’s partner. The dressmaker wrapped her in a muslin cutout of the pattern. “I felt so beautiful,” she recalled. They were invited to a friend’s party up in Woodinville that night, a sleepover kind of thing so that people wouldn’t have to worry about driving home. But they were both feeling tired. They decided to go back to South Park instead.",26,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"They bought steaks and potatoes—“stuff that she loved”—and while Butz grilled the steaks outside, her partner made the rest of the meal inside. There was a phone call from Butz’s mom. “This beautiful, amazingly connected call with her mom, who she loved so amazingly much,” her partner recalled. It sounded like Butz’s mom, who is Catholic and had some reservations about their commitment ceremony, would indeed be coming. “While they may not have agreed with our choice,” Butz’s partner said on the stand of some members of her partner’s family, “there was no question that they loved Teresa, and there was no question that they loved me.”",27,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Dinner. Then a movie that had been lying around the house for a while, a musical that made them both cry. It was around midnight. Butz checked the locks multiple times (like always), she brushed her teeth multiple times while flossing in between (like always), she took the left side of the bed (like always) right next to her water and her lip balm. Her partner took the right side of the bed (like always). They said good night.",28,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I kind of leaned in to her and said, ‘I love you so much,’” Butz’s partner recounted.",29,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“She said, ‘I know you do.’ And that was it. We went to sleep.”",30,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Butz’s partner doesn’t know how long they slept.,31,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I woke up to a start,” she told the court. “There was a man that I could see was naked, standing over the bed with a knife in his right hand… And the knife immediately went to my throat.”",32,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,She gasped. She thought: This is a dream.,33,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“And then,” she told the court, “it’s just processing that there’s a person here and something’s going to happen.”",34,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"She didn’t immediately know if Butz was awake with her, but she didn’t want to take her eyes off the man in order to find out.",35,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“He said, ‘Be quiet, be quiet.’ Because I made that noise or whatever. And he said: ‘I don’t want to hurt you. I just want pussy.’”",36,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He told them to take their clothes off. Butz was already awake.,37,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Her partner remembers her saying: “Sir, I’m on my period.”",38,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,The man’s response: “I don’t care.”,39,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“So she took her pants off, and her shirt as well, and he got on top of her,” Butz’s partner told the court. “He started raping her.”",40,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The man held onto the knife the whole time, kept it ready. (Prosecutors brought the alleged knife to court as evidence. It was more than a foot long from tip to handle.)",41,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I was as still as humanly possible,” Butz’s partner said. “I feel like I tried to put my arm as close to her as possible so she would know that I was there. I was terrified. I thought he’d kill us with the knife. I’d already had it to my throat. Already it was clear, you know—the energy was, if you don’t do what he says, he’ll kill her… It wasn’t just our own lives that we were worried about… I know when I laid there still I was thinking, ‘If I am good, he won’t hurt her.’”",42,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"After a time, Butz’s partner said on the stand, “He got off of her, and he told me to take my clothes off, which I did. And then he told her, ‘Lick her pussy.’ And she got in the position, but she didn’t do it. She pretended. I was really grateful for that. But I remember I could just feel her near me. And I watched him walk by the dresser near the window, and he just, one by one, shut all three windows.”",43,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"In the courtroom, it felt like windows were closing. Everyone was still, as if hoping that this would keep him from hurting them.",44,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He raped Butz’s partner next.,45,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I remember I laid very still, or very flat. I remember thinking, ‘Just get through it and he’ll go. He’ll go. Don’t do anything crazy.’”",46,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"She recounted how he smelled (“clean”), what his build was like (“muscular”), his race (“black”), how much hair he had on his body (“very little”), the volume of his voice (“soft”), the speed of his speech (“medium”), and the manner in which he spoke (“Other than using the word pussy, which kind of seemed lower brow, to be honest, the rest of his speech was very intelligent”).",47,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"She remembered feeling Butz reach for her arm, remembered Butz saying, “I’m so sorry.”",48,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“Then,” Butz’s partner told the court, “he told me to get on my knees on the bed.”",49,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,The prosecuting attorney asked: Why?,50,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“Because he wanted to. Well, he did. He put his penis in my anus.”",51,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Already, Butz had been praying out loud through the ordeal: “Our father, please help us. Our father in heaven…” Her partner now started praying, too: “Please, God, let us live.”",52,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Then, “He stopped and he stepped away. And he told Teresa to get down on the floor on her knees in front of him… I heard him say ‘swallow,’ and I heard what sounded like gagging noises from her.”",53,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Butz’s partner visualized waiting, getting through this, the man leaving, then calling someone to come get them. At some point, he was done forcing Butz to perform oral sex and the two women both “scuttled up” on the bed, backs against the headboard, knees pressed to chests, arms around knees. Butz told him their purses were in the kitchen, that they didn’t have much cash but he could have whatever he wanted.",54,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“He said, ‘I’m not going to hurt you. Don’t worry, I’m not going to hurt you.’ Then he said, and I remember: ‘Don’t get too excited. That was just round one.’”",55,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"He stood there, leaning against the dresser in their bedroom, naked, knife in hand, staring. “He wasn’t smiling. He wasn’t scowling. He was just staring.”",56,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"For Butz’s partner, this waiting for more pain was worse than experiencing the pain in the moment.",57,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,The prosecuting attorney asked: How many rounds were there altogether?,58,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,“Three.”,59,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"H er first day of testimony ended. The next morning, June 9, she was back on the witness stand. In a building filled with trial horrors, this courtroom was about to go well beyond the normal—beyond what most people are brave enough to imagine, let alone recount. Some of her testimony from this day is not going to be recounted in this story. It got very gruesome. But in order to understand her courage it’s necessary to hear, as much as possible, what she lived through.",60,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Butz’s mother sat listening to the testimony on one of the wooden benches, just as she had every day of the trial so far, other members of the Butz family tight on either side of her. She is a small woman, just like her daughter, who was only five feet two. One thought: If this woman can absorb, at the level of detail required for proof before a jury, the particulars of what happened to her daughter—can view the bloody crimescene photographs, can listen to the 911 call from a neighbor leaning over her blood-soaked daughter and screaming, “Ma’am, please wake up! Please wake up!” (while, to the 911 operator pleading, “Please hurry, please hurry”), can hear the testimony about DNA evidence and what orifices it was recovered from—then no one else in this courtroom can dare turn away. Butz’s mother’s presence, too, created an imperative: This happened. You must listen.",61,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Isaiah Kalebu, the man accused of these crimes, sat in a sealed courtroom on a higher floor, deemed so uncontrollable he’s been banned from his own trial, left to watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television while strapped into a restraint chair and dressed in a thick green flop of fabric known as a “suicide smock.” (No ties, strings, sleeves, or other possible aides to self-harm.) Up to this point in the trial, Kalebu hadn’t been fighting his confinement in the upstairs courtroom, but this morning, of all mornings, he changed from his suicide smock into a dress shirt and slacks and requested that he be allowed to sit in the eighth-floor courtroom with his accuser. After his lawyers went up and talked to him, he retracted the request.",62,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Butz’s partner began her second day of testimony with the awful silence of the man standing there that night, leaning against the dresser, staring, promising more. ""So much had already happened. I was trying to imagine what else…” And: “I didn’t feel like Teresa and I could communicate. I didn’t feel like I could tell her ‘I love you’… I almost thought it would be worse, and I don’t know why, if he knew I loved her too much.”",63,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"He said to the two women: “All right, get ready for round two.”",64,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The horror of what happened next made the court reporter’s eyes well up, made the bailiff cry, had the whole room in tears. The jury handed around a box of tissues. The prosecutor took long pauses to collect himself. The family and friends in the courtroom cried (though, truth be told, they had been crying throughout). The Seattle Times reporter seated next to me cried. I cried. The camerawoman who was shooting video for all the television stations in town cried—and later on hugged Butz’s partner as she left the courtroom for the midmorning break.",65,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Perhaps it is enough to restate how one of the two prosecuting attorneys summarized the attacks in opening arguments at the beginning of the trial. Kalebu, this prosecutor said, “raped them every way imaginable. Vaginally, anally, orally. He wasn’t wearing a condom, and he ejaculated several times.”",66,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Perhaps it is enough to listen to some of their conversations during the later phases of these attacks, as Butz’s partner recounted them on the stand.",67,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The man asked the couple for lube before one of his rapes of Butz. When the women replied that they didn’t have any lube, he said: “Too bad for her.”",68,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The man asked, at one point: “So are you guys lesbians or are you bisexual?”",69,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Butz’s partner’s mind spun. Which would be worse? Which answer would make him more likely to stop? “I remember what I said was, ‘Well, we’ve been together a long time, so I guess that makes us lesbians.’”",70,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"She felt that she deserved to ask him a question at this point, so she asked: “Have you seen us before?”",71,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He shook his head no.,72,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Butz asked: “What if we’d been an old man?”,73,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He just shrugged.,74,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Butz’s partner made up a story that someone was coming to pick them up at 5:00 a.m. to take them to a wedding in Portland. She asked him if they were going to make the wedding. He said yes. She said: “Please don’t hurt us. We’re good people.”,75,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"He said: “Yeah, you seem like you’re good people. I wish we could have been friends.”",76,2012

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“Which,” her partner said on the stand, “is exactly what she would do… Even in that moment, she wanted to make some sort of connection. She said, ‘Maybe we still can.’”",78,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He asked: “Do I seem like a good person to you?”,79,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“She put the tips of her fingers on his chest—I will never ever forget this— and said, ‘I am sure there is some good in here.’”",80,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He said: “No more questions.”,81,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I just did what I had to do,” Butz’s partner said. “At one point, I felt the tip of the knife just kind of touch my arm. I said, ‘Ouch!,’ and he actually said, ‘Oh, I’m sorry.’”",82,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,She remembers thinking: “There’s no way he’d say ‘I’m sorry’ and be a murderer. We’re going to get through this. There’s got to be some level of compassion there or something.”,83,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"At one point, Butz made a play for the knife. He said: “Don’t do that! Don’t do that!”",84,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Butz’s partner, who was being raped at that moment, and was in a more vulnerable position, also said to Butz: “Don’t do that. Don’t do that.”",85,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Butz stopped trying to get the knife. The man said: “I know you’re going to call the police. They all do. But I’m going to be long gone. I always am.”,86,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“Maybe we won’t,” Butz’s partner told him.",87,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“Well, you might not,” he said.",88,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Then he looked at Butz: “But she will.”,89,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The attacks became more sadistic. Things began to happen that were beyond the worst imagining of Butz’s partner. She felt like she was going to be ripped in half. She thought: “He’s not going to kill me with a knife, but he’s going to kill me this way.”",90,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Then she heard Butz say: “Why are you cutting me? Why are you cutting me?”,91,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The man said to Butz: “Shut up, or I’m going to kill your girlfriend.”",92,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"He took the women into another room in the house, where he pulled another knife out of a pair of jeans he’d left on a guest bed.",93,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The story he had been telling them, the story Butz’s partner had been telling herself, the story that he just wanted sex and was not going to hurt them, now completely shattered. “In that moment I just knew he was going to kill us,” Butz’s partner told the court. “I just knew. There was something different in his gaze. There was this kind of looking. I didn’t feel fear from him, I didn’t feel anger from him, I just felt this nothing.”",94,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"He made them go back into their bedroom. They pleaded with him, tried to think of what they could possibly say. They told him they were on the board of a nonprofit that helps homeless people, which was true. He didn’t respond. They were back on the bed, on their backs, one of his knees on each of them, pinning them down, a knife in each of his hands.",95,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,The next thing she heard was Butz saying: “You got me. You got me. You got me.” He had stabbed Butz in the heart.,96,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I remember thinking, ‘No. No. No. No. No. No. No. We were supposed to get to leave. We were supposed to get to go. She can’t be dying.’”",97,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The man was slashing and stabbing Butz’s partner, too.",98,2012

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,She stopped fighting and released.,106,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,“The next thing I felt was just this powerful surge of energy.”,107,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,Butz had pushed and kicked the man off of the bed.,108,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,“I remember screaming: ‘Get him!’”,109,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,He punched Butz in the face. (An autopsy later showed her three bottom teeth broken and pushed back.) Butz grabbed the nightstand.,110,2012

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"No stories mattered anymore. No hopes. No promises. It was now fight or flight in that room, kill or be killed. Butz threw the table through the window. She pushed herself through the jagged glass, fell to the ground outside, got up, sprinted to the curb, ran into the street. Then, her partner said, “As quickly as she started running, she just fell straight back.”",112,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The man and Butz’s partner were still standing there in the bedroom, and they looked at each other.",113,2012

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I remember I couldn’t get the front door open because my hands were too bloody,” she told the court. Eventually, she did get it open and she ran to the neighbors across the street, ran past her partner lying on her back on South Rose Street, because both of them needed help right now, because it seemed like they didn’t have much time. “Just ran as fast as I could,” Butz’s partner told the court. She was naked. They were both naked. She reached the neighbors’ front door.",116,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"“I bang on the door as hard as I can,” she said. As she did, she noticed the skin open on one of her arms, muscle popping through.

Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"And then civilization, which did not stop this from happening, which did not even know this was happening, slowly returned, slowly wrapped itself back around the women, layer by insufficient layer.",120,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"Butz’s partner saw a young Hispanic man running toward them. “He just ran,” she told the court. She saw a young woman leaning over her partner. Neighborhood kids, up late on a warm night, were coming to help. One of them took off a sweatshirt and gave it to Butz’s partner. “I just grabbed her sweatshirt and held it up to my neck,” she said. She told a young man to call her mom on his cell phone and tell her she loved her. “And the next thing I remember at this point is an officer coming up to me and kind of abruptly telling me to stop screaming.” The officer asked: Is the bad guy gone? Which way did he go? He needed to secure the area before the firemen, waiting down the block, could rush in, blue smocked and white gloved, and try and help whomever they could. “I remember they came to me”—the firemen—“and they didn’t go to her, and I was like, ‘Go to her! Go to her!’” Other firemen and medics would go to Butz, but it would be too late.",121,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The canine unit would come to track the man’s scent. An emergency room physician would swab Butz’s partner for evidence and, for a time, with her best interests in mind, withhold from her the information that Butz had been killed. The coroner would autopsy Butz’s body. The crime lab would process the evidence: fingerprints on the dresser and the bathtub, a bloody footprint on a piece of paper that had been on the floor, DNA in and on the bodies of the two women. Detectives would run down leads, match the prints and DNA directly to Kalebu.",122,2012
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"One of the detectives, a woman named Dana Duffey, would call one day while Butz’s partner sat in St. Louis at one of Butz’s favorite places, a bar and restaurant overlooking the Mississippi River. Detective Duffey would tell her: “We have him.” (And—no joke—fireworks would go off right at that moment across the river, an accident on the part of some worker preparing for a later show.) State psychiatrists would evaluate Kalebu and declare him competent. King County prosecutors, well aware that Kalebu had been repeatedly held—and repeatedly released—by the state’s mental health and criminal justice systems in the 16 months before the South Park attacks, would prepare to try to put him away for life this time.

Arias, like most commercial fishermen, lived frugally. He shared a spartan one-bedroom apartment in Wildwood with another fisherman and used a bicycle to get around town. A trip to the area known as the Elephant Trunk, the richest scallop grounds on the East Coast, meant he and the other six men aboard the Lady Mary might pocket $10,000 to $15,000 each — more for the captain — for a week to 10 days at sea.",15,2011

To him, it appeared the container or cargo ship had slowed considerably, perhaps even stopped. Not far from the ship, he noticed the green mast-light of a fishing boat flickering in the dark. Normally, just below the green light, is a white light, part of a signal system that indicates to vessels in the vicinity that the boat is a fishing trawler and is underway. Taylor observed neither a white signal, nor the fishing boat’s bright deck lights, which are usually turned on whether the vessel is dredging or not.",95,2011

In these rare cases the nearest vessel-tracking service must be notified. Traffic monitoring is required by international law, mostly as a way for large ships to avoid hitting each other. AIS is a line-of-sight signal, and reception on land depends in large part on the height of the antenna.",96,2011

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"The helicopter hovers, just 300 feet from the surface of the roiling sea. It is a delicate dance, trying to hold position in 35-knot winds above a moving, surging surface. An MH-65C helicopter normally carries 1,600 pounds of fuel, which it burns at a rate of about 600 pounds an hour when flying. When hovering, however, it burns more, as much as 750 pounds an hour.",180,2011

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Adrenaline surging, Downham removes his helmet and takes out the ear plugs that help save his hearing from the violent roar of the rotors and engine. He puts on his fins, mask and snorkel, and hooks onto the hoist that will lower him into the water.",182,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"When the flight mechanic, Jason Oyler, pats Downham on the chest — the ""go"" sign — he detaches himself from the safety belt tethering him to the inside of the helicopter.",183,2011

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Even in his dry suit, Downham is staggered by the cold. At 80 miles an hour, the rotor wash scalds his face, and with his flotation vest, lifting harness, radio, strobe light, pocket flares and knives, he has added another 45 to 50 pounds to his already considerable frame.",185,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Disconnecting from the hoist, he is in essence a 300-pound man swimming toward a moving life raft, in 10-foot seas, half a football field away.",186,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Before he gets to the raft, Downham realizes the ""arm"" waving at the helicopter is actually the flap over the entrance to the covered raft. Peeking inside, his spirits sink again. No one. Just a few supplies — food, a radio, the usual survival items, wrapped in plastic, unopened.",187,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"After radioing the information to the helicopter, Downham slits the lifeboat with his knife and deflates it.

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Quickly, Downham dons his gear again, and about 8:40 a.m. is lowered on the hoist and swims out to the man in the water. Six-foot swells carry the rescue swimmer up and down the heaving seas. Every few seconds, José Arias catches sight of the man in the dry suit, his neon-yellow arms thrashing powerfully toward him.",195,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"""I’m a Coast Guard swimmer and I’m going to get you out of here,"" Downham announces to Arias, just like he’s been taught.

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"""Thank you. Gracias. Thank you,"" Arias says, over and over, switching between English and Spanish. Downham struggles to pull the man’s arms off the plank and push it away, but Arias resists. The piece of wood has saved his life. Downham will have none of it. His job is to rescue people in distress, and that’s what he does, even if it means he has to manhandle them a bit.",197,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"The fastest way up into the helicopter is the harness, or lifting strop, since it’s secured under the arms and legs, but when someone has been in cold water for any length of time, it’s also more dangerous. Hanging vertically from the strop, the body’s blood will suddenly drain away from the core where it was redirected in the frigid water to keep the heart and lungs warm. Saved from hypothermia, the victim could easily go into cardiac arrest before reaching the helicopter door.",198,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Downham gives Oyler a thumbs up, which means drop the 4-foot-long metal basket. Buoyant cushions attached to the top edges of the basket allow it to float, and Downham pushes Arias in, headfirst. The slack cable whips around both men, threatening to entangle them, so when Downham signals Oyler to start the hoist, the rescue swimmer clings to the bottom of the basket until the cable is taut, then drops 5 feet back into the water. Oyler will send the hoist down for him after Arias is safely aboard.",199,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"When both men are in the helicopter, Downham opens a special hypothermic blanket and drapes it around Arias’ shoulders. Then Oyler taps Downham on the back. The flight mechanic points out the door of the helicopter, and down. Someone else has been spotted in the water.",200,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"As he’s lowered a second time, Downham sees the orange survival suit is facedown, and he’s worried he’s too late. Swimming through the churning water, he can tell the man’s eyes are open.",201,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"""Hey! Hey!"" he yells as he turns the body face up, just as he’s been taught. He rubs hard on the man’s sternum with his knuckles to try to get a pain response. The technique can sometimes rouse a person from unconsciousness, but Downham’s sternum rub produces no reaction at all. The victim’s eyes are fixed, his mouth is open slightly and a white cable is wrapped around his legs.",202,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Downham calls again for the basket, pushes and pulls the body into it, then gives Oyler the thumbs up. When it’s his turn to be hoisted, Downham just reaches the helicopter door and sees Oyler again pointing downward — another survival suit in the water.",203,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"The helicopter has been hovering for nearly 20 minutes, quickly burning through its ""bag"" of gas. Before Downham is lowered again, co-pilot Tuohy gives him a sign: five fingers, or five minutes to ""bingo,"" the cutoff time for the chopper to get back to land with a safe margin of fuel.",204,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"When Downham reaches the second body, it, too, is turned facedown, eyes open and unresponsive. It’s clear from the stiffness of the arms and legs that rigor mortis has set in. Downham realizes he can’t call for the basket — it’s only 4 feet long and is meant for sitting. This man is at least 6 feet tall and has rigor mortis. He doesn’t even know Tuohy has been unable to move the first body out of the basket. The strop is the only alternative.",205,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"This is his fourth time in the water, and Downham tries not to think about his screaming muscles. The cold is starting to numb his fingers, even though he’s wearing special gloves, and he fumbles to secure the harness to the body. When he finally does, he hooks himself onto the hoist, just above the body, and the two are lifted together.",206,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"After he unhitches, Downham helps Oyler pull the body in, but the man’s legs are so rigid they stick out the door of the helicopter. Peña has to head back — now — or she risks ditching the chopper in the sea. But she can’t go until the door is closed. It takes all the strength Downham and Oyler have to bend the body and get the legs inside.",207,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"It’s close to 9 a.m. when Peña points the helicopter northwest. They had a tail wind out. Now they’re in a head wind. The trip back will not only take longer, it will use up more fuel.",208,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"After Downham removes his mask, snorkel and fins, he feels helpless for the first time. Neither body appears to have vital signs, but he can’t just sit there. With Oyler’s help, he reaches into the basket and pulls on the man’s legs until his back is flat against the bottom, then begins CPR.",209,2011

When he does, seawater gushes out. Downham flinches, worried all the saltwater might short-out the helicopter’s electronics. After slicing through Tim’s wet undershirt, and applying several conduction pads to Tim’s chest, Downham tries to shock the fisherman back to life, twice.",211,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Every time he looks up from his work, he catches Arias’ eyes, and when he does, Arias asks, almost pleadingly, ""He okay, yes?""",212,2011

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"• The marks on the propeller blades, which indicate they were still turning when the propeller was pushed against the rudder. That scoring could only have happened on the surface, when the Lady Mary’s engine was still engaged, say proponents of the collision theory. When she finally sank she lost all power, which means the propeller was no longer turning when the Lady Mary hit the sea floor.",395,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"• The way the port side of the transom is bowed-in, indicating an impact from a rounded object, such as a container ship’s bulbous bow.",396,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"One of the Coast Guard assumptions in the terminal velocity calculations, according to members of the forensics committee, is that the rudder buckled when the boat hit the bottom.",397,2011
Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"""I don’t agree with that,"" said George Edwards, a committee member and naval engineer at CSC Advanced Marine.

Amy Ellis Nutt,2010-11-21,The Wreck of the Lady Mary,"Like the other divers, Steve Gatto, who was in the first group to dive on the wreck of the Lady Mary, believes the vertical-hit scenario is improbable because of the pristine condition of the gallows, a large rectangular frame that supports the dredge.

Photos of the interior of the Lady Mary’s wheelhouse and control panel, specifically the open throttle and the rudder gauge, said Belousofsky, appear to confirm the boat was turning when she foundered.

She is the first to admit that her temperament contributed to the death of her son, Bryce, two years ago. It happened on March 30, 2007, the day she accidentally left the 9-month-old in the parking lot of the Charlottesville judge advocate general's office, where she worked as a transportation administrator. The high temperature that day was only in the 60s, but the biometrics and thermodynamics of babies and cars combine mercilessly: Young children have lousy thermostats, and heat builds quickly in a closed vehicle in the sun. The temperature in Balfour's car that day topped 110 degrees.",64,2010
Gene Weingarten,2009-03-08,Fatal Distraction,"There's a dismayingly cartoonish expression for what happened to Lyn Balfour on March 30, 2007. British psychologist James Reason coined the term the ""Swiss Cheese Model"" in 1990 to explain through analogy why catastrophic failures can occur in organizations despite multiple layers of defense. Reason likens the layers to slices of Swiss cheese, piled upon each other, five or six deep. The holes represent small, potentially insignificant weaknesses. Things will totally collapse only rarely, he says, but when they do, it is by coincidence -- when all the holes happen to align so that there is a breach through the entire system.",65,2010

Because the baby was also tired, he uncharacteristically dozed in the car, so he made no noise. Because Balfour was planning to bring Bryce's usual car seat to the fire station to be professionally installed, Bryce was positioned in a different car seat that day, not behind the passenger but behind the driver, and was thus not visible in the rear-view mirror. Because the family's second car was on loan to a relative, Balfour drove her husband to work that day, meaning the diaper bag was in the back, not on the passenger seat, as usual, where she could see it. Because of a phone conversation with a young relative in trouble, and another with her boss about a crisis at work, Balfour spent most of the trip on her cell, stressed, solving other people's problems. Because the babysitter had a new phone, it didn't yet contain Balfour's office phone number, only her cell number, meaning that when the sitter phoned to wonder why Balfour hadn't dropped Bryce off that morning, it rang unheard in Balfour's pocketbook.",66,2010

Though they were starving, the baby monkeys all climbed into the warm cloth arms.",47,2009

Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"The most recent case of a feral child was in 1970, in California. A girl whom therapists came to call Genie had been strapped to a potty chair until she was 13. Like the Wild Boy, Genie was studied in hospitals and laboratories. She was in her 20s when doctors realized she'd never talk, never be able to take care of herself. She ended up in foster care, closed off from the world, utterly dependent.",49,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Danielle's case — which unfolded out of the public spotlight, without a word in the media — raised disturbing questions for everyone trying to help her. How could this have happened? What kind of mother would sit by year after year while her daughter languished in her own filth, starving and crawling with bugs?",50,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"And why hadn't someone intervened? The neighbors, the authorities — where had they been?",51,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""It's mind-boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child who's just left in a room like a gerbil,"" said Tracy Sheehan, Danielle's guardian in the legal system and now a circuit court judge. ""No food. No one talking to her or reading her a story. She can't even use her hands. How could this child be so invisible?""",52,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,But the most pressing questions were about her future.,53,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"When Danielle was discovered, she was younger by six years than the Wild Boy or Genie, giving hope that she might yet be teachable. Many of her caregivers had high hopes they could make her whole.",54,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Danielle had probably missed the chance to learn speech, but maybe she could come to understand language, to communicate in other ways.",55,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Still, doctors had only the most modest ambitions for her.",56,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""My hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night, to be out of diapers and to feed herself,"" Armstrong said. If things went really well, she said, Danielle would end up ""in a nice nursing home.""",57,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Danielle spent six weeks at Tampa General before she was well enough to leave. But where couldshe go? Not home; Judge Martha Cook, who oversaw her dependency hearing, ordered that Danielle be placed in foster care and that her mother not be allowed to call or visit her. The mother was being investigated on criminal child abuse charges.",58,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""That child, she broke my heart,"" Cook said later. ""We were so distraught over her condition, we agonized over what to do.""",59,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Eventually, Danielle was placed in a group home in Land O'Lakes. She had a bed with sheets and a pillow, clothes and food, and someone at least to change her diapers.",60,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"In October 2005, a couple of weeks after she turned 7, Danielle started school for the first time. She was placed in a special ed class at Sanders Elementary.",61,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""Her behavior was different than any child I'd ever seen,"" said Kevin O'Keefe, Danielle's first teacher. ""If you put food anywhere near her, she'd grab it"" and mouth it like a baby, he said. ""She had a lot of episodes of great agitation, yelling, flailing her arms, rolling into a fetal position. She'd curl up in a closet, just to be away from everyone. She didn't know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing. She didn't want to be touched.""",62,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"It took her a year just to become consolable, he said.",63,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,By Thanksgiving 2006 — a year and a half after Danielle had gone into foster care — her caseworker was thinking about finding her a permanent home.,64,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"A nursing home, group home or medical foster care facility could take care of Danielle. But she needed more.",65,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""In my entire career with the child welfare system, I don't ever remember a child like Danielle,"" said Luanne Panacek, executive director of the Children's Board of Hillsborough County. ""It makes you think about what does quality of life mean? What's the best we can hope for her? After all she's been through, is it just being safe?""",66,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"That fall, Panacek decided to include Danielle in the Heart Gallery — a set of portraits depicting children available for adoption. The Children's Board displays the pictures in malls and on the Internet in hopes that people will fall in love with the children and take them home.",67,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"In Hillsborough alone, 600 kids are available for adoption. Who, Panacek wondered, would choose an 8-year-old who was still in diapers, who didn't know her own name and might not ever speak or let you hug her?",68,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"The day Danielle was supposed to have her picture taken for the Heart Gallery, she showed up with red Kool-Aid dribbled down her new blouse. She hadn't yet mastered a sippy cup.",69,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Garet White, Danielle's care manager, scrubbed the girl's shirt and washed her face. She brushed Danielle's bangs from her forehead and begged the photographer to please be patient.",70,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"White stepped behind the photographer and waved at Danielle. She put her thumbs in her ears and wiggled her hands, stuck out her tongue and rolled her eyes. Danielle didn't even blink.",71,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"White was about to give up when she heard a sound she'd never heard from Danielle. The child's eyes were still dull, apparently unseeing. But her mouth was open. She looked like she was trying to laugh.",72,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Teenagers tore through the arcade, firing fake rifles. Sweaty boys hunched over air hockey tables. Girls squealed as they stomped on blinking squares.",73,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie and Diane Lierow remember standing silently inside GameWorks in Tampa, overwhelmed. They had driven three hours from their home in Fort Myers Beach, hoping to meet a child at this foster care event.",74,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"But all these kids seemed too wild, too big and, well, too worldly.",75,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie, 48, remodels houses. Diane, 45, cleans homes. They have four grown sons from previous marriages and one together. Diane couldn't have any more children, and Bernie had always wanted a daughter. So last year, when William was 9, they decided to adopt.",76,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Their new daughter would have to be younger than William, they told foster workers. But she would have to be potty-trained and able to feed herself. They didn't want a child who might hurt their son, or who was profoundly disabled and unable to take care of herself.",77,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"On the Internet they had found a girl in Texas, another in Georgia. Each time they were told, ""That one is dangerous. She can't be with other children.""",78,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"That's why they were at this Heart Gallery gathering, scanning the crowd.",79,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie's head ached from all the jangling games; Diane's stomach hurt, seeing all the abandoned kids; and William was tired of shooting aliens.",80,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Diane stepped out of the chaos, into an alcove beneath the stairs. That was when she saw it. A little girl's face on a flier, pale with sunken cheeks and dark hair chopped too short. Her brown eyes seemed to be searching for something.",81,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Diane called Bernie over. He saw the same thing she did. ""She just looked like she needed us.""",82,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie and Diane are humble, unpretentious people who would rather picnic on their deck than eat out. They go to work, go to church, visit with their neighbors, walk their dogs. They don't travel or pursue exotic interests; a vacation for them is hanging out at home with the family. Shy and soft-spoken, they're both slow to anger and, they say, seldom argue.",83,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"They had everything they ever wanted, they said. Except for a daughter.",84,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"But the more they asked about Danielle, the more they didn't want to know.",85,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She was 8, but functioned as a 2-year-old. She had been left alone in a dank room, ignored for most of her life.",86,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"No, she wasn't there at the video arcade; she was in a group home. She wore diapers, couldn't feed herself, couldn't talk. After more than a year in school, she still wouldn't make eye contact or play with other kids.",87,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"No one knew, really, what was wrong with her, or what she might be capable of.",88,2009

Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,But they couldn't forget those aching eyes.,90,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"When they met Danielle at her school, she was drooling. Her tongue hung from her mouth. Her head, which seemed too big for her thin neck, lolled side to side.",91,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She looked at them for an instant, then loped away across the special ed classroom. She rolled onto her back, rocked for a while, then batted at her toes.",92,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Diane walked over and spoke to her softly. Danielle didn't seem to notice. But when Bernie bent down, Danielle turned toward him and her eyes seemed to focus.",93,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"He held out his hand. She let him pull her to her feet. Danielle's teacher, Kevin O'Keefe, was amazed; he hadn't seen her warm up to anyone so quickly.",94,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie led Danielle to the playground, she pulling sideways and prancing on her tiptoes. She squinted in the sunlight but let him push her gently on the swing. When it was time for them to part, Bernie swore he saw Danielle wave.",95,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"That night, he had a dream. Two giant hands slid through his bedroom ceiling, the fingers laced together. Danielle was swinging on those hands, her dark eyes wide, thin arms reaching for him.",96,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Everyone told them not to do it, neighbors, co-workers, friends. Everyone said they didn't know what they were getting into.",97,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,So what if Danielle is not everything we hoped for? Bernie and Diane answered. You can't pre-order your own kids. You take what God gives you.,98,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"They brought her home on Easter weekend 2007. It was supposed to be a rebirth, of sorts — a baptism into their family.",99,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""It was a disaster,"" Bernie said.",100,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"They gave her a doll; she bit off its hands. They took her to the beach; she screamed and wouldn't put her feet in the sand. Back at her new home, she tore from room to room, her swim diaper spewing streams across the carpet.",101,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She couldn't peel the wrapper from a chocolate egg, so she ate the shiny paper too. She couldn't sit still to watch TV or look at a book. She couldn't hold a crayon. When they tried to brush her teeth or comb her hair, she kicked and thrashed. She wouldn't lie in a bed, wouldn't go to sleep, just rolled on her back, side to side, for hours.",102,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"All night she kept popping up, creeping sideways on her toes into the kitchen. She would pull out the frozen food drawer and stand on the bags of vegetables so she could see into the refrigerator.",103,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""She wouldn't take anything,"" Bernie said. ""I guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there.""",104,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"When Bernie tried to guide her back to bed, Danielle railed against him and bit her own hands.",105,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"In time, Danielle's new family learned what worked and what didn't. Her foster family had been giving her anti-psychotic drugs to mitigate her temper tantrums and help her sleep. When Bernie and Diane weaned her off the medication, she stopped drooling and started holding up her head. She let Bernie brush her teeth.",106,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie and Diane already thought of Danielle as their daughter, but legally she wasn't. Danielle's birth mother did not want to give her up even though she had been charged with child abuse and faced 20 years in prison. So prosecutors offered a deal: If she waived her parental rights, they wouldn't send her to jail.",107,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She took the plea. She was given two years of house arrest, plus probation. And 100 hours of community service.",108,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"In October 2007, Bernie and Diane officially adopted Danielle. They call her Dani.",109,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""Okay, let's put your shoes on. Do you need to go potty again?"" Diane asks.",110,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"It's an overcast Monday morning in spring 2008 and Dani is late for school. Again. She keeps flitting around the living room, ducking behind chairs and sofas, pulling at her shorts.",111,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"After a year with her new family, Dani scarcely resembles the girl in the Heart Gallery photo. She has grown a foot and her weight has doubled.",112,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"All those years she was kept inside, her hair was as dark as the dirty room she lived in. But since she started going to the beach and swimming in their backyard pool, Dani's shoulder-length hair has turned a golden blond. She still shrieks when anyone tries to brush it.",113,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"The changes in her behavior are subtle, but Bernie and Diane see progress. They give an example: When Dani feels overwhelmed she retreats to her room, rolls onto her back, pulls one sock toward the end of her toes and bats it. For hours. Bernie and Diane tell her to stop.",114,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Now, when Dani hears them coming, she peels off her sock and throws it into the closet to hide it.",115,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She's learning right from wrong, they say. And she seems upset when she knows she has disappointed them. As if she cares how they feel.",116,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Bernie and Diane were told to put Dani in school with profoundly disabled children, but they insisted on different classes because they believe she can do more. They take her to occupational and physical therapy, to church and the mall and the grocery store. They have her in speech classes and horseback riding lessons.",117,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Once, when Dani was trying to climb onto her horse, the mother of a boy in the therapeutic class turned to Diane.",118,2009

Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""Lucky?"" Diane asked.",120,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"The woman nodded. ""I know my son will never stand on his own, will never be able to climb onto a horse. You have no idea what your daughter might be able to do.""",121,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,Diane finds hope in that idea. She counts small steps to convince herself things are slowly improving. So what if Dani steals food off other people's trays at McDonald's? At least she can feed herself chicken nuggets now. So what if she already has been to the bathroom four times this morning? She's finally out of diapers.,122,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"It took months, but they taught her to hold a stuffed teddy on the toilet so she wouldn't be scared to be alone in the bathroom. They bribed her with M&M's.",123,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""Dani, sit down and try to use the potty,"" Diane coaxes. ""Pull down your shorts. That's a good girl.""",124,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Every weekday, for half an hour, speech therapist Leslie Goldenberg tries to teach Dani to talk. She sits her in front of a mirror at a Bonita Springs elementary school and shows her how to purse her lips to make puffing sounds.",125,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""Puh-puh-puh,"" says the teacher. ""Here, feel my mouth."" She brings Dani's fingers to her lips, so she can feel the air.",126,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,Dani nods. She knows how to nod now. Goldenberg puffs again.,127,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Leaning close to the mirror, Dani purses her lips, opens and closes them. No sound comes out. She can imitate the movement, but doesn't know she has to blow out air to make the noise.",128,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She bends closer, scowls at her reflection. Her lips open and close again, then she leaps up and runs across the room. She grabs a Koosh ball and bounces it rapidly.",129,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,She's lost inside herself. Again.,130,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"But in many ways, Dani already has surpassed the teacher's expectations, and not just in terms of speech. She seems to be learning to listen, and she understands simple commands. She pulls at her pants to show she needs to go to the bathroom, taps a juice box when she wants more. She can sit at a table for five-minute stretches, and she's starting to scoop applesauce with a spoon. She's down to just a few temper tantrums a month. She is learning to push buttons on a speaking board, to use symbols to show when she wants a book or when she's angry. She's learning it's okay to be angry: You can deal with those feelings without biting your own hands.",131,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"""I'd like her to at least be able to master a sound board, so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice,"" Goldenberg says. ""I think she understands most of what we say. It's just that she doesn't always know how to — or want to — react.""",132,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Dani's teacher and family have heard her say only a few words, and all of them seemed accidental. Once she blurted ""baaa,"" startling Goldenberg to tears. It was the first letter sound she had ever made.",133,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"She seems to talk most often when William is tickling her, as if something from her subconscious seeps out when she's too distracted to shut it off. Her brother has heard her say, ""Stop!"" and ""No!"" He thought he even heard her say his name.",134,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"Having a brother just one year older is invaluable for Dani's development, her teacher says. She has someone to practice language with, someone who will listen. ""Even deaf infants will coo,"" Goldenberg said. ""But if no one responds, they stop.""",135,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"William says Dani frightened him at first. ""She did weird things."" But he always wanted someone to play with. He doesn't care that she can't ride bikes with him or play Monopoly. ""I drive her around in my Jeep and she honks the horn,"" he says. ""She's learning to match up cards and stuff.""",136,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"He couldn't believe she had never walked a dog or licked an ice cream cone. He taught her how to play peek-a-boo, helped her squish Play-Doh through her fingers. He showed her it was safe to walk on sand and fun to blow bubbles and okay to cry; when you hurt, someone comes. He taught her how to open a present. How to pick up tater tots and dunk them into a mountain of ketchup.",137,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"William was used to living like an only child, but since Dani has moved in, she gets most of their parents' attention. ""She needs them more than me,"" he says simply.",138,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"He gave her his old toys, his ""kid movies,"" his board books. He even moved out of his bedroom so she could sleep upstairs. His parents painted his old walls pink and filled the closet with cotton-candy dresses.",139,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"They moved a daybed into the laundry room for William, squeezed it between the washing machine and Dani's rocking horse. Each night, the 10-year-old boy cuddles up with a walkie-talkie because ""it's scary down here, all alone.""",140,2009
Lane DeGregory,2008-08-03,The Feral Child,"After a few minutes, while his parents are trying to get Dani to bed, William always sneaks into the living room and folds himself into the love seat.",141,2009

Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"Each passerby had a quick choice to make, one familiar to commuters in any urban area where the occasional street performer is part of the cityscape: Do you stop and listen? Do you hurry past with a blend of guilt and irritation, aware of your cupidity but annoyed by the unbidden demand on your time and your wallet? Do you throw in a buck, just to be polite? Does your decision change if he's really bad? What if he's really good? Do you have time for beauty? Shouldn't you? What's the moral mathematics of the moment?",3,2008

No one knew it, but the fiddler standing against a bare wall outside the Metro in an indoor arcade at the top of the escalators was one of the finest classical musicians in the world, playing some of the most elegant music ever written on one of the most valuable violins ever made.

Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"The acoustics proved surprisingly kind. Though the arcade is of utilitarian design, a buffer between the Metro escalator and the outdoors, it somehow caught the sound and bounced it back round and resonant. The violin is an instrument that is said to be much like the human voice, and in this musician's masterly hands, it sobbed and laughed and sang -- ecstatic, sorrowful, importuning, adoring, flirtatious, castigating, playful, romancing, merry, triumphal, sumptuous.",6,2008

That was Bell playing the soundtrack on the 1998 movie ""The Red Violin."" (He body-doubled, too, playing to a naked Greta Scacchi.)

Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"One biographically intriguing fact about Bell is that he got his first music lessons when he was a 4-year-old in Bloomington, Ind.

Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"Like the instrument in ""The Red Violin,"" this one has a past filled with mystery and malice. Twice, it was stolen from its illustrious prior owner, the Polish virtuoso Bronislaw Huberman. The first time, in 1919, it disappeared from Huberman's hotel room in Vienna but was quickly returned. The second time, nearly 20 years later, it was pinched from his dressing room in Carnegie Hall. He never got it back. It was not until 1985 that the thief -- a minor New York violinist -- made a deathbed confession to his wife, and produced the instrument.",45,2008

Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"Bell decided to begin with ""Chaconne"" from Johann Sebastian Bach's Partita No. 2 in D Minor. Bell calls it ""not just one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, but one of the greatest achievements of any man in history. It's a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful, structurally perfect. Plus, it was written for a solo violin, so I won't be cheating with some half-assed version.""",51,2008
Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"Bell didn't say it, but Bach's ""Chaconne"" is also considered one of the most difficult violin pieces to master. Many try; few succeed. It's exhaustingly long -- 14 minutes -- and consists entirely of a single, succinct musical progression repeated in dozens of variations to create a dauntingly complex architecture of sound. Composed around 1720, on the eve of the European Enlightenment, it is said to be a celebration of the breadth of human possibility.",52,2008
Gene Weingarten,2007-04-08,Pearls Before Breakfast,"If Bell's encomium to ""Chaconne"" seems overly effusive, consider this from the 19th-century composer Johannes Brahms, in a letter to Clara Schumann: ""On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind.""",53,2008

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The family posed last year for a Sears-style portrait, taken by a woman in Bay Ridge who photographs Muslim families in her basement. A blue sky and white picket fence adorn the background. The imam sits at center, with the baby, Mohammed, in his lap, his three daughters smiling, his wife wrapped in a lime-green hijab.",47,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Mr. Shata carries the picture in the breast pocket of his robe. It is as close as most people get to his family. At the mosque, they are a mystery. His wife has been there twice.",48,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Their years in America have come with great hardship, a subject the imam rarely discusses. The trouble is the illness of his 7-year-old daughter, Rawda, who is severely epileptic. She has dozens of seizures every day and rarely leaves home. No combination of medicine seems to help.",49,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""Rawda is the wound in my heart,"" the imam said.",50,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Mr. Shata offers long, stubborn theories about the value of marriage, but to observe him at home is to understand the commitment he seeks to foster in other Muslims.",51,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The family lives in a spare, dimly lighted apartment two blocks from the mosque. Headscarves are piled over Pokémon cards. The gold-painted words ""Allah is Great"" are framed over a threadbare couch. In the next room, an ""I {sheart} New York"" bumper sticker is slapped on the wall.",52,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Mr. Shata spends long hours away from his family, lecturing at mosques, settling disputes, whispering the call to prayer in the ears of newborn babies. On his walk home at night, he shops for groceries, never forgetting the Honey Nut Cheerios, a favorite American discovery of his children.",53,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"When he walks in the door, his face softens. Loud kisses are planted on tender cheeks. Mohammed squeals, the girls smile, sweet laughter echoes.",54,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,But then there is Rawda.,55,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""My beautiful girl,"" the imam says softly one evening, holding his limp daughter in his lap after a seizure has passed. He places one pill in Rawda's mouth, then another. She looks at him weakly.",56,2007

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Hardship, the imam believes -- like marriage, like life -- is a test from God.",59,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,It is proof of the imam's uncommon popularity among women that he is trusted with roughly 300 female marriage candidates.,60,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The mosque on Fifth Avenue is a decidedly male place. Men occupy every position on the board of directors. They crowd the sidewalk after prayer. Only they may enter the mosque's central room of worship. Only men, they often point out, are required to attend the Friday prayer.",61,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"One floor below is the cramped room where the women worship. On Fridays, they sit pressed together, their headscarves itching with heat. They must watch their imam on a closed-circuit television that no one seems to have adjusted in years.",62,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"But they listen devotedly. Teenage girls often roll their eyes at foreign imams, who seem to them like extraterrestrials. Their immigrant mothers often find these clerics too strict, an uncomfortable reminder of their conservative homelands.",63,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Mr. Shata is both foreign and familiar. He presides over a patriarchal world, sometimes upholding it, and other times challenging it. In one sermon, he said that a man was in charge of his home and had the right to ""choose his wife's friends.""",64,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Another day, to the consternation of his male congregants, he invited a female Arab social worker to lecture on domestic violence. The women were allowed to sit next to the men in the main section of the mosque.",65,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The imam frowns at career women who remain single in their 30's, but boasts of their accomplishments to interest marriage candidates. He employs his own brand of feminism, vetting marriage contracts closely to ensure brides receive a fair dowry and fighting for them when they don't.",66,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Far more than is customary, he spends hours listening to women: to their worries and confessions, their intimate secrets and frank questions about everything from menstruation to infidelity. They line up outside his office and call his home at all hours, often referring to him as ""my brother"" or ""father."" He can summon the details of their lives with the same encyclopedic discipline he once used to memorize the Koran.",67,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""Are you separated yet?"" Mr. Shata asked a woman he encountered at Lutheran Medical Center one day last July. She nodded. ""May God make it easier for you,"" he said.",68,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"By most standards, the Egyptian bachelor was a catch. He had broad shoulders and a playful smile. He was witty. He earned a comfortable salary as an engineer, and came from what he called ""a good family.""",69,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"But the imam saw him differently, as a young man in danger of losing his faith. The right match might save him.",70,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The bachelor, who is 33, came to Brooklyn from Alexandria, Egypt, six years earlier. He craved a better salary, and freedom from controlling parents. He asked that his name not be printed for fear of causing embarrassment to his family.",71,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"America was not like Egypt, where his family's connections could secure a good job. In Brooklyn, he found work as a busboy. He traded the plush comfort of his parents' home for an apartment crowded with other Egyptian immigrants. His nights were lonely. Temptation was abundant.",72,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Women covered far less of their bodies. Bare limbs, it seemed, were everywhere. In Islam, men are instructed to lower their gaze to avoid falling into sin.",73,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""In the summertime, it's a disaster for us,"" said the bachelor. ""Especially a guy like me, who's looking all the time.""",74,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Curiosity lured him into bars, clubs and the occasional one-night stand.",75,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"But with freedom came guilt, he said. After drifting from his faith, he visited Mr. Shata's mosque during Ramadan in 2004.",76,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The imam struck him as oddly disarming. He made jokes, and explained Islam in simple, passionate paragraphs. The bachelor soon began praying daily, attending weekly lectures and reading the Koran. By then, he had his own apartment and a consulting job.",77,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,Now he wanted a Muslim wife.,78,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"If the bachelor had been in Egypt, his parents would offer a stream of marriage candidates. The distance had not stopped them entirely. His mother sent him a video of his brother's wedding, directing him to footage of a female guest. He was unimpressed.",79,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""I'm a handsome guy,"" he explained one evening as he sped toward Manhattan. It was his second date with Mr. Shata in attendance. ""I have a standard in beauty.""",80,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"From the passenger seat, the imam flipped open the glove compartment to find an assortment of pricey colognes. He inspected a bottle of Gio and, with a nod from the bachelor, spritzed it over his robe.",81,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The imam and the bachelor were at odds over the material world, but on one thing they agreed: it is a Muslim duty to smell good. The religion's founder, the Prophet Muhammad, was said to wear musk.",82,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The car slowed before a brick high-rise on Second Avenue. Soon the pair rode up in the elevator. The bachelor took a breath and rang the doorbell. An older woman answered. Behind her stood a slender, fetching woman with a shy smile.",83,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The young woman, Engy Abdelkader, had been presented to the imam by another matchmaker. A woman of striking beauty and poise, Ms. Abdelkader is less timid than she first seems. She works as an immigration and human rights lawyer, and speaks in forceful, eloquent bursts. She is proud of her faith, and lectures publicly on Islam and civil liberties.",84,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"She was not always so outspoken. The daughter of Egyptian immigrants, Ms. Abdelkader, 30, was raised in suburban Howell, N.J., where she longed to fit in. Though she grew up praying, in high school she chose not to wear a hijab, the head scarf donned by Muslim girls when they reach puberty.",85,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"But Sept. 11 awakened her, Ms. Abdelkader said. For her and other Muslims, the terrorist attacks prompted a return to the faith, driven by what she said was a need to reclaim Islam from terrorists and a vilifying media. Headscarves became a statement, equal parts political and religious.",86,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""There's nothing oppressive about it,"" said Ms. Abdelkader. ""As a Muslim woman I am asking people to pay attention to the content of my character rather than my physical appearance.""",87,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"The pair sat on a couch, awkwardly sipping tea. They began by talking, in English, about their professions. The bachelor was put off by the fact that Ms. Abdelkader had a law degree, yet earned a modest salary.",88,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"""Why go to law school and not make money?"" he asked later.",89,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,Ms. Abdelkader's mother and a female friend who lived in the apartment sat listening nearby until the imam mercifully distracted them. The first hint of trouble came soon after.,90,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"It was his dream, the engineer told Ms. Abdelkader, to buy a half-million-dollar house. But he was uncertain that the mortgage he would need is lawful in Islam.",91,2007

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,An argument ensued. Voices rose. Ms. Abdelkader's mother took her daughter's side. The friend wavered. The bachelor held his ground. The imam tried to mediate.,93,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"Indeed, he was puzzled. Here was a woman who had grown up amid tended lawns and new cars, yet she rejected materialism. And here was a man raised by Muslim hands, yet he was rebelliously moderate.",94,2007
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-07,Tending to Muslin hearts and Islam's future,"After the date, the bachelor told the imam, ""I want a woman, not a sheik.""",95,2007
