C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Sam Siatta was deep in a tequila haze, so staggeringly drunk that he would later say he retained no memory of the crime he was beginning to commit.",1,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"It was a few minutes after 2 a.m. on April 13, 2014. Siatta had just forced his way into a single-story home in Normal, Ill., a college town on the prairie about 130 miles southwest of Chicago. A Marine Corps veteran of the war in Afghanistan, he was a 24-year-old freshman studying on the G.I. Bill at the university nearby, Illinois State. He had a record of valor in infantry combat and no criminal past. He also had no clear reason to have entered someone else’s home, no motive that prosecutors would be able to point to at trial — no intention to rob, no indication that he knew or had even seen before any of the three young female teaching students who lived inside, or the boyfriends who were with two of them.",2,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Two of the women and one of the men had awakened minutes earlier when they thought they heard someone opening and closing the front door. It had been an unnerving sensation, the feeling that an intruder had stepped into the home. They tried to settle themselves and return to bed, only to be jolted by a house-shaking bang — the sound of Siatta hitting the back door with such force that he splintered the jamb.",3,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The door swung open into a dining area. Siatta strode into the unfamiliar space, just around the block from the similarly sized home where he rented a room. A little more than six feet tall and weighing about 175 pounds, he was a thoroughly trained veteran of a small-unit ground war and heavily tattooed, with red tally marks on his sternum indicating seven Taliban kills from 2009 and 2010. His former company commander would later tell a trial judge that of the 388 troops he led in Afghanistan, Siatta was the man the militants feared most.",4,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,The women cowered behind a flimsy bedroom door. One of them dialed 911. Another clutched a stubby kitchen knife.,5,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Since leaving the corps in 2012, Siatta had been unable to switch off the habits of war. He was hypervigilant and struggled to relax. He watched people, sizing them up and scanning for threats. In the varying situations of everyday life, he constantly repositioned himself so no one got behind him. Much of this was appropriate for combat patrols. Some of it drew from his training. All of it was mentally and emotionally exhausting, unsuited for a peaceful life. Going to a restaurant, moving through knots of people at a party, visiting the mall, finding a seat in a classroom relative to other people and windows and doors — each was a challenge requiring effort and will.",6,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had been in a deepening funk for months. For more than four years he had been stalked by memories of civilians his platoon had killed, people whose lives had abruptly ended for a reason as unforgiving as it was simple — being in the wrong place when the shooting began. The Department of Veterans Affairs would later say he suffered from depression, alcohol dependency and PTSD. But until this moment, he had adapted with behaviors allowing him to pass as less troubled than he was. He avoided crowds. He drank prodigious amounts of alcohol to dim his heightened alertness and to muffle his sorrows. He socialized rarely, often only with his mother or brother.",7,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The dining area Siatta had entered gave way to a little kitchen, which opened into a small living room. In that adjoining room, perhaps 25 feet from Siatta, stood one of the boyfriends, another young former Marine. In any number of situations, the two men might have become friends. But they had served in different places and jobs in the corps, and the man in the living room had no idea he had anything in common with the man in the kitchen. He positioned himself between his girlfriend and the shattered door.",8,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He was shorter than Siatta but more muscular, with a build hinting at years of weight training and competitive wrestling. He was also sober. He looked across the kitchen at the broken door. The deadbolt was still extended. Whoever had forced the door was strong. He heard movement around the corner, a rustling from the back of the house. He held a steak knife with a serrated eight-inch blade, the weapon he managed to muster in the seconds he had to think.",9,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta stepped into his line of sight. He was walking toward the living room, deeper into the house.",10,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Only one man knows exactly what happened next. Knife in hand, he identified himself as a former Marine and demanded that Siatta get out.",11,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“You don’t belong here,” he said. “You need to leave.”",12,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta kept walking, the man said, and lifted a frying pan off the stove as he passed by. “You have been bad,” he said, raising the pan by its handle. “And this will do.”",13,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Whatever options had existed narrowed to one. The fight began.,14,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The first time I saw Sam Siatta was in April 2016 at the Shawnee Correctional Center, a medium-security state penitentiary in southern Illinois. He was brought by the guards to a dreary conference room, away for the moment from a cellblock for serious offenders. Before he arrived, a correctional officer asked me and two members of the law firm representing Siatta whether we wanted a guard stationed nearby, in case the inmate acted up.",15,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta walked in wearing blue prison garb. He had the light feet and muscular shoulders of a young fighter. His short sleeves offered glimpses of grim tattoos — a skull resting on an hourglass on his right forearm, among others — common to many grunts. He looked tough. He also looked deflated. He came off as nervous, scared and almost painfully polite, a man overwhelmed by his circumstances.",16,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Richard R. Winter, the attorney who days before had filed an appeal of Siatta’s conviction, asked how he was doing. Any pretense of Siatta as a threat to visitors fell away. He was not doing well. Shawnee, he said, was run by gangs, which he had to take care not to cross. Two cellmates had been Latin Kings, and another was a sex offender who had almost drawn Siatta into a fight over a petty cellblock theft. The aging penitentiary in Pontiac, where he was held while awaiting a court hearing, was worse. There the inmates shouted and wailed through the night, he said, and the place was thick with rodents.",17,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta seemed distraught. He wanted to go home. Did Winter have any news, he wanted to know, about his appeal? Winter gently said it would take time, perhaps a few months before they could expect a hearing.",18,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I had heard of Siatta in February, when T.G. Taylor, a recently retired Army officer, contacted me about a Marine infantry vet who had forced his way into a house in his neighborhood and been stabbed repeatedly by another former Marine. After a helicopter flight to a trauma center, the infantry vet — Siatta — was charged with home invasion, found guilty at trial and sentenced to prison. Taylor had taken a job at Holland & Knight, the firm handling the appeal, which was brought on the grounds that Siatta did not intend to commit the crime because he was almost catatonically intoxicated at the time. Siatta’s case, Taylor said, was about PTSD, a subject he and I had discussed over the years as we tried to help friends struggling with life after war. I was interested but cautious. I served in the Marine infantry in the 1980s and 1990s and knew what everyone who has moved past the slogans knows: That a small fraction of Marines are trouble — problem children, in the gentlest construction of the corps’ otherwise profane slang. Some of these Marines turn criminal and deserve every bit of punishment they get. I told Taylor that I would have to review the case carefully before considering coverage.",19,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By chance, I knew Maj. Scott A. Cuomo, who commanded Siatta’s rifle company in Afghanistan. Cuomo is driven and serious. He had led the school that trains all Marine infantry lieutenants, a post reserved for established stars in the grunt officer corps. I called him with two questions: Was Siatta a problem child? If not, what was going on? Cuomo said Siatta was a solid Marine in combat — a gifted marksman, trusted by his peers, invaluable in firefights and deserving of gratitude, not incarceration. He said he was perplexed by everything he heard out of Illinois.",20,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Reading the case file raised more questions. The prosecutors had taken a hard stance against Siatta, first with charges and in plea negotiations and later in a deposition and in court, where a prosecutor belittled the idea that the accused might have been drunk as a coping mechanism for post-combat illness. Not everyone in the courtroom seemed to concur. At the end, when Siatta’s life had finally tanked, the trial judge all but apologized for sentencing him to prison.",21,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I agreed to meet Siatta in Shawnee. Over a few hours of conversation, he toggled between being marginally expressive and almost poetic. At this late date he had developed a cleareyed view of what ailed him. He described his anxiety and drinking as conditions that grew almost imperceptibly, finally overtaking him in 2014. Until then the symptoms had been easy for him to play down, even if others were concerned. “You don’t notice when you grow half an inch, because you see yourself every day,” he said. “But if you see your loved ones, they say, ‘Oh, you’ve gotten tall.’?”",22,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Once he relaxed, Siatta talked of the killing he had done in Afghanistan — hesitantly at first, then thoroughly — replaying the cool mechanics of precision rifle fire, describing fatal mistakes, tracing where his mind traveled after. His war had been darker than his new lawyer and family knew, more brutal than he expressed in court. It was too late to expect anything to come of it. More than five years remained on his sentence, and Siatta was unlikely to receive help from Illinois’s overburdened correctional system in that time, not even counseling or medication. His fate would depend on a long-shot appeal, which focused on a narrow and not firmly established matter of law. In the waste and shame of a respected vet being warehoused in a penitentiary for a crime he could not recall was part of the foot soldiers’ experience of the Afghan war, including the return to a country content to thank them without understanding them, or why they sometimes stand apart.",23,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Lance Corporal Samuel J. Siatta arrived in Afghanistan in October 2009, one of thousands of Marines who cycled through the effort to defeat the Taliban in Helmand Province, the corps’ ambitious piece of President Obama’s first-term reboot of the Afghan war. He was a rifleman in Fox Company, Second Battalion, Second Marines, a member of First Squad, Third Platoon.",24,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"As he stepped off the aircraft at Camp Leatherneck, a base on the steppe that served as a hub for Marine operations, he was an almost timeless character, a young Marine from the prairie who might have fit into the long lines of riflemen volunteering for his service’s previous wartime campaigns. An adopted son in a Roman Catholic family in Illinois, he was handed to the couple who raised him on the Fourth of July in 1989, when he was 3 days old. His mother’s eldest brother fought as a Marine in Vietnam, and his maternal grandfather was a Marine in World War II. By the time he was in the fourth grade, he was telling grown-ups that he intended to be a Marine.",25,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"His father fell ill with cancer and died when Siatta was 12. Siatta had always been a quiet child and was more so after. A sixth-grade classmate, Ashley Volk, found him approachable and kind. The two dated that year. “He was my first kiss on the cheek,” she said. Volk made a condolence card for their class to sign and puzzled over how he contained his grief. “Sam never cried in front of us,” she said. “It always made us scared for him, because we didn’t know how he was dealing with it inside.”",26,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By eighth grade, Siatta had started lifting weights and hanging out at the gym. Volk worked out as an excuse to be near him. The war in Iraq was raging. The Pentagon’s early success in Afghanistan was unraveling. Anyone could see there was much more fighting ahead, and against foes whose harassing and often dark tactics, emphasizing ambushes, improvised bombs and suicide attacks, were exacting a bloody toll. Siatta let it be known that he still intended to enlist.",27,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta and Volk were an off-again, on-again couple in high school, years during which she tried to talk him out of becoming a Marine. He gave her nicknames, including “pretty lady” and “gypsy,” and resisted her efforts to dissuade him. As a senior he was old enough to sign on the line. Volk pleaded with him again. His decision was firm. He had an urge for action and a sense of duty, and seemed not to care how hard or risky it would be. “It wasn’t about enjoying it,” he told me. “It was about the idea that our Constitution isn’t a bunch of toilet paper, like most of our generation thinks it is.” He enlisted while still in school and requested a place in the infantry, the corps’ toughest job.",28,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"With four years signed away, Siatta began seeing less of Volk, thinking that it would be unfair to leave her waiting while he was gone to war. He departed for boot camp in San Diego on the day he graduated, in May 2008. Volk remembers feeling scared. But she had no argument left to make. “He did it for our country,” she said. “That’s an old soul.”",29,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At boot camp Siatta followed the familiar arc of transformation from civilian to Marine, although as weeks passed he displayed a skill that set him apart: He was an exceptional shot. The Marine Corps is built around its rifles. It expects every member to master what it considers the basic tool of modern war, via thorough training and annual requalification on shooting out to 500 yards. Siatta outshot almost everyone around him. This was not readily explicable. Siatta was raised in a household without firearms and was neither a hunter nor a weapons buff. He had never fired a rifle before.",30,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Instructors in the corps often say that recruits with no weapons experience can become accomplished shots because they have no bad habits to unlearn. Siatta offers this as the explanation for his own superior skill. But when he talks of how he shot, it is also clear that when he looked down the barrel of a rifle he was capable of extreme patience and calm. Even in firefights he could sweep away distraction and focus on the habits that make precision marksmanship possible.",31,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In late 2008, after completing boot camp and an infantry course in which he demonstrated a knack for mixed martial arts and a high pain tolerance to go with his fine motor skills, Siatta checked into his battalion at Camp Lejeune, N.C. In many ways, two of his supervisors said, he was not a model Marine. He wore his uniform sloppily, could be inattentive in garrison and did not show the enthusiasm and initiative of some of his peers. He was pegged as “a field Marine,” a grunt suited for battle but not for the corps’ broader insistence on perfection. “Sometimes we’d say that if Siatta did not shoot as well as he did, we wouldn’t know what to do with him,” said his former squad leader, Sgt. Joseph M. Perez. Siatta accepts this reputation easily and said he chafed at the spit-shine requirements of Marine Corps base life. “They’d say, ‘Your boots are dirty,’?” he told me. “And I’d be like: ‘Of course they are dirty. I’m a fucking rifleman. I joined to do a dirty job.’?” All agree that his skill with a rifle assured his place. As his platoon readied for combat, its commander, Second Lt. Tyler P. Kurtz, selected him for a particularly difficult role: designated marksman.",32,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The D.M., as troops call this position, was a recent adjustment to the corps’ small-unit organization, a role between that of regular riflemen and snipers. It was made necessary, in the corps’ view, by the arid environments of Afghanistan and Iraq, where a dearth of vegetation often meant that gunfights occurred at long ranges, and conventional units needed Marines with skills and equipment to hit targets outside the ready range of standard M4s or M16s. Rare is the Marine who does not wish to shoot better; a culture that celebrates riflery bestows credibility and respect on those who shoot best. Siatta’s selection was an honor, the more so because he was otherwise untested. Kurtz, now a captain who commands a Marine infantry company, said he chose Siatta nonetheless because he exuded maturity when behind a rifle. “He was a natural,” he said.",33,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s selection brought pressures he had not contemplated before. In Afghanistan he would be called on to do the shooting that would make gunfights stop. Through the lens of a telescopic sight, he would also be expected to watch over and protect his platoon, which meant eyeing civilians through cross hairs, one after another, and looking for indicators — a partly hidden weapon, the remote detonator of a bomb — that might give him a military justification to kill. This would require a constant commitment to discernment and a disciplined sense of restraint, balanced with a willingness to take others’ lives, sometimes in the intimate fashion that can come with an eight-power scope. Even the nickname for the role, Guardian Angel, was freighted with a presumption of unerring perfection and righteous power.",34,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had shot only paper targets. He wondered whether he was good enough. What would happen to his friends, he asked himself, if he choked?",35,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The prewar preparations of Second Battalion, Second Marines left little time for rest. Siatta lived in Fox Company’s barracks, where underage drinking was forbidden and policed by noncommissioned officers. He was too young to purchase alcohol legally or enter bars and did not show much interest in alcohol in any event. His fellow Marines recall him hanging back, unlike some of the louder personalities. “He was very quiet, very internal, one of the guys who didn’t say much,” Perez said. “When he spoke, it was pretty comical, because it was like, ‘Whoa, where did that come from?’?”",36,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In late October 2009, the battalion landed in Afghanistan and quickly moved into the rural badlands. In keeping with the corps’ latest way of waging war, its Marines were to spend a seven-month tour characterized by an unrelenting pace of small foot patrols. At Camp Leatherneck, Fox Company was given its first mission: to set up in patrol bases near the village of Lakari, drive off the Taliban and help the Afghan government extend security and services into the area.",37,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"It was an ambitious order. Helmand Province, Afghanistan’s largest, had had a light Western military presence since 2001. Much of it had taken the form of British units in fortified outposts with limited influence over territory around them. After a bloody campaign in Iraq’s Anbar Province, the Marine Corps shifted attention to Helmand, turning the province into the corps’ own corner of Afghanistan. The villages around Lakari, nestled amid irrigated cropland along the winding Helmand River about 90 miles from Pakistan, formed a Taliban and drug-runners’ stronghold. Other Marines raided Lakari in the summer, but they left, and the area remained beyond the Afghan government’s reach. The local bazaar, on dusty land east of the river, was a no-go zone — full-on enemy turf.",38,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 1, the company’s First and Third Platoons arrived at Patrol Base Lakari, a crude outpost built weeks before. Little more than tents surrounded by a 13-foot-high dirt berm, it had the hastily conceived and temporary feel of much of the Marine involvement in Afghanistan. It was reached through a gate and watched over by four raised bunkers where Marines rotated turns on post, one in each bunker by day, two by night.",39,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"From behind sandbags and bulletproof glass, the Marines looked upon a desolate vista and could feel menace awaiting them. Like the bazaar, about a mile to the south, the patrol base was situated just outside the irrigated cropland, at the edge of the steppe. Vegetation and a maze of dried mud walls lay to the west and southwest. The year’s poppy crop had been harvested. A stubble of corn stalks dotted the landscape. The farmers between the base and the bazaar were presumed to be spotters who watched the Americans’ routine and signaled their movements to the Taliban. No patrol could leave the base without being seen before it reached the fields.",40,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Whenever Marines ventured into the neighboring patchwork of farmland, canals and homes, they were entering a network of interconnected traps. Small slits had been cut in the mud walls — Marines called them “murder holes” — from which the Taliban could fire. Bombs had been buried in the dirt. Ambushes were laid by fighters who typically kept a canal between themselves and their targets, preventing the Marines from employing their preferred tactic of rushing attackers. The patrol base was a target for rockets. The Marine unit that had lived in it for the past few weeks was leaving Afghanistan, ending its tour and passing to Fox Company a mission that would require small-unit gunfighting on someone else’s home ground. In his journal, Siatta recorded his first impression, in standard grunt-speak: “The coffee here tastes like shit.”",41,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By 2009, the eighth year of its Afghan occupation, the United States had repeatedly reshaped its reasons and practices for fighting its post-Sept. 11 wars. Under ideas in favor at this moment, nicknamed COIN, the military’s inelegant shorthand for its optimistically conceived counterinsurgency doctrine, troops were expected to follow a three-stage process to declaw and displace the Taliban: clear, hold and build. This meant sweeping through an area to weaken opposing fighting groups by force and then holding the ground and trying to secure it over time, all in the service of allowing the central government’s local project to take root and grow. At the same time, Marines were told to coach Afghan forces and befriend villagers (in part by handing out cash) and urge them into roles (informants, contractors, local officials) that would make them partners in the new way. They were also supposed to encourage farmers to abandon the cultivation of opium poppy, the region’s most lucrative cash crop.",42,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"That was the theory and the hope, often officially expressed. In practice it meant destroying a firmly established local economy and bringing in rule by outsiders. And the first phase — “clearing” — was a euphemism for violence, repeatedly applied via small gunfights and supported by American artillery and air power. A corollary, often unstated but understood by those doing the patrols, was that any group of Afghans willing to face the Marines head to head would gradually be thinned, while every seven months the Americans, bloodied and made jumpy by firefights and bombs, would be replaced with fresh troops. It was small-scale attrition warfare, with hearts-and-minds jive.",43,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s turn came quickly. On Nov. 2, his second day at the patrol base, Third Platoon was gathering to meet the Marines they were replacing when two rockets roared in and exploded, one inside and another outside the perimeter. Siatta ran for his equipment — flak jacket, helmet, first-aid kit and the rest — and stood with his rifle waiting for a ground attack that never came. He was at war now, “heart racin, hands shakin but had a smile on my face,” he wrote in his journal. “I dont know why I was smilin maybe it was because I could have got blown the fuck up and didn’t.”",44,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"To stop incoming rockets, the patrols would have to make the Taliban think twice about taking such risks. That night, Siatta was issued a Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle, the more accurate descendant of the M16, which he would carry throughout his tour, along with open-tip match-grade ammunition, a departure from the military’s standard full-metal jacket rounds that sacrificed armor penetration but caused more damaging soft-tissue wounds. The rifle was equipped with a suppressor to muffle its report. Siatta was a hunter now. Clearing the fields around Lakari was his job. He was 20 years old.",45,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On a section of steppe the Marines called “the eastern desert,” Siatta adjusted the rifle’s scope. His practice range, an empty expanse of compacted soil and tiny tufts of dried grass, was safe. The local fighters did not leave the security of their home turf to fight in the open. Like an athlete stretching on a sideline before competition, Siatta made his last preparations. Methodically firing into rations boxes, he determined and wrote down the data for exact distances, then set the scope for 300 yards and taped the chart to his rifle’s stock. He was ready.",46,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad was green. Its leader, Sergeant Perez, was the only Marine who had been in combat before. The first patrol passed without incident. But Fox Company was aggressive, and within days its Marines were pushing beyond where the departing unit had regularly gone. They were looking for fights.",47,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At the lower ranks of the Marine Corps, the Pentagon’s airbrushed language of war can fade away. Tactical slang hews closer to battlefield fact. Marines talk of “bait patrols,” in which one group of grunts heads off to a contested area trying to draw fire, while others wait, hoping that once the Taliban show themselves they can attack their flanks. And they talk of the most straightforward mission of all: movement to contact, which means exactly that.",48,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 7, Siatta’s squad, accompanied by Lieutenant Kurtz and a machine-gun team, headed just over a mile south and stopped beside a house to talk with whoever approached. Siatta’s journal entry that day was unequivocal about the purpose.",49,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Now let me be clear our mission was not to talk to the locales and shot the shit. Our mission was to get the Talibans atention and hopefully have them attach use and give there position away.,50,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The battalion leaving Afghanistan was opposed to the mission. Kurtz faced contradictory orders. His company commander was telling him to push south, while the operations officer in the command center was ordering him back. The Marines headed back.",51,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On the return walk, they were attacked. “Gunfire opens up out of a tree line,” Siatta’s journal reads. “Rounds cracking and snaping through the air and skipin across the ground.”",52,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad reacted as infantry units in their first firefight often do. Most of the Marines opened up with everything they had. Siatta found a position along a mud wall, fired a few shots and then stopped. Through his scope he saw nothing to shoot.",53,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Around him others cut loose. The squad’s M249 automatic weapons and M240 machine gun tore through belts of ammunition. The fire-team leaders lobbed one high-explosive 40-mm grenade after another. Lance Cpl. Dustin J. Hagglund, who led the machine-gun team, described it afterward as “an ammo dump, basically.” Two cows, he said, were cut in half. The firefight was of a familiar type: a swift and ferocious clash between combatants who scarcely glimpsed one another. Beyond signaling toughness and an eagerness to fight, it accomplished little. “We did the suppression, we closed with them and we pulled back,” Lance Cpl. Jeffrey Ratliff said. The Taliban also withdrew. No one, it seemed, had been struck.",54,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The Marines strode back to their patrol base, exuberant, riding the rush of having been under fire and coming out alive. This is one of war’s exhilarating drugs. It fueled backslaps and shouts. “Everyone was like high-fiving and everything,” Hagglund told me. “We were the first squad in the company to get in a firefight.”",55,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,A few minutes later Hagglund was in a bunker when a Toyota pickup rushed toward the gate. It stopped short. Its occupants hopped out and retrieved a wheelbarrow from the bed. A few Afghan soldiers ran to meet them. In the wheelbarrow was a small boy who had been shot through the skull.,56,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The bullet had struck above his left eyebrow and blown out the back of his head. But it had hit high enough that the child was still alive — unresponsive, breathing fitfully. The man pushing the wheelbarrow was his father. Siatta watched as the Marines took the child to their aid station and rested his shattered skull over a stainless-steel bowl. A corpsman tried to keep what was left of his head intact by cupping it in his hands. A sandstorm had blown up, grounding the helicopter fleet. It was a few hours before an aircraft took him away. Not long after, the radio brought word. The boy had died.",57,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Hagglund thought the child might be 4 years old. Siatta and Perez thought he might be 6. No one was exactly sure how he had been shot. Ratliff figured he was hit while running through the gunfight to save the cows. The corpsman who examined the wound said it was caused by a 5.56-millimeter bullet, which matched weapons that the Marines carried. Perez tried consoling his squad. “This is how it works,” he said. “Rounds go everywhere in firefights, and as hard as we try to prevent civilian casualties, this is going to happen sometimes.” He reminded them that they had not shot first. They were ambushed. But words, he knew, had limits. “My guys felt guilty,” he said.",58,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After the first night, the Marines barely discussed the boy’s death. “We just kind of did the man thing, and we did not talk about it ever again,” Perez said. Hagglund described a collective reticence. “None of us talked about our feelings,” he said. “We were gung-ho. We were taking care of business.” They bleached the stainless-steel bowl, ate out of it and went back out on patrols.",59,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was shaken. His training had not prepared him for what it felt like to look down after a gunfight upon a child with part of his head gone. “During all of our work-up, shooting targets, throwing grenades, doing all that, you never once saw kids mangled,” he told me. The boy reminded him of his niece. He was one firefight into the only line of work he had ever wanted and was confronted with “one of those sights — it was like maturity overnight, a sobering.”",60,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Fox Company intended to clear the area around Lakari quickly. The next week was a blur. “Nothing,” Siatta wrote in his journal, “but firefight, rockets, ambushes, post resuply missions and just chaos.”",61,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"On Nov. 17, the platoon commander, Kurtz, accompanied the squad, reinforced with a machine-gun team and Afghan soldiers, on a mission deep into Taliban turf. He had noticed a pattern. After each gunfight, the Taliban’s fighters seemed to withdraw to the same fields and buildings west of the bazaar. Kurtz was sick of it and planned to walk straight into their area, summon them to a fight and kill as many of them as he could. “It was a pure and simple movement to contact, and nothing else,” he said.",63,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad set off in midmorning. To Kurtz’s surprise, no Taliban fighters showed up. “Basically we humped all day,” he said. The squad continued a few miles west of the bazaar, into an area where no Marines had been before, when an ambush erupted around part of it. One team of Marines was filing across a field when the Taliban opened fire. The range was short. The ambushers were about 200 yards away. Following their training, the Marines in the kill zone turned toward the gunfire and charged. Those in the strip of vegetation between the fields alternated between shooting and rushing, trying to envelop the attackers.",64,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"An Afghan soldier fired a rocket-propelled grenade near the lieutenant, and the back blast nearly deafened him. The Taliban was firing with a PK machine gun, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. The squad was spread out, with Perez and Siatta moving with a team a few hundred yards off. Perez looked behind his Marines and saw a man on a roof about 300 yards away, partly hidden by a wall. He raised his four-power scope for a closer view. The man did not seem to be holding anything but was watching the fight, perhaps directing the Taliban.",65,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was beside Perez with an eight-power scope. Under the rules, Marines were required to have “PID” — positive identification — of a combatant before firing. Even warning shots were forbidden without an officer’s approval. Another platoon had recently shot an Afghan with a radio, only to discover that the radio was a harmless transistor for listening to the news and that the man had a mental disability. The Marines had been warned about avoiding more mistakes.",66,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta kept his sight on the man. He did not see a weapon, a radio or a cellphone. But he was suspicious. Perez told him to fire a warning shot and chase the man off. “I told Siatta to shoot under the guy,” he told me.",67,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta fired. The man collapsed. Perez lowered his M4 and looked down at Siatta. “Did you just shoot that man?” he asked.,68,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The squad fought south for about 600 yards, clearing several buildings. At one point they were taking fire from a compound, and as Kurtz was organizing an airstrike, he saw, through a gap in the wall, a woman inside. She was holding a baby. Kurtz thought the Taliban might have pushed her into view as a human shield. He called off the airstrike. Some of the Marines watched several unarmed men sprinting away from a building they were closing on and asked for permission to shoot them. Kurtz thought the fleeing men were combatants who had ditched their weapons. But again, he said, he followed the rules. He ordered the squad not to fire. It was a maddening fight, under an ornate system of restrictions that the Taliban knew how to exploit, a style of war that could enrage those who followed it. “A lot of the guys in the squad were pissed at me that day,” Kurtz said.",71,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Back at their base, Perez asked Siatta to explain his shot. “Were you sighted on that guy?” he said.",72,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Perez was angry and concerned. He reported the incident to Kurtz, and the company began investigating Siatta. Kurtz, too, was disturbed. He sensed trouble. Villagers had been gathering at the gate, complaining about every mistake Fox Company made. Kurtz expected they would soon arrive with a body.",75,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He warned Siatta that he stood to face charges. “We’ll see how this plays out for you, bud,” he told him. Kurtz took away his rifle and suspended him from patrols. Siatta was near tears. Perez supported the lieutenant’s position and said he wondered about Siatta’s suitability for war. “There is a difference between wanting to kill a person and killing the right person,” he said. “Our concern was that Siatta would fall into the trap of killing for pleasure, which he had the ability to do.”",76,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Years later, the shot remains a point of contention. Siatta said he understood the reprimand but steadfastly defends his actions. “This is one of the stressors of being a designated marksman,” he told me. “You have to make that call. That guy was bad news. That was a shady guy.” In the same circumstance, he said, he would take the shot again. “You could save your buddies’ lives,” he said, “at the expense of your own ass.” Perez said these answers are unacceptable. “He can say the guy looked shady, but that doesn’t give you the right to shoot him,” he said. “If I let my squad shoot everyone who was shady, we could have killed an entire village.”",77,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"For a few days, Third Platoon patrolled without Siatta. Everyone waited. The villagers did not appear. A patrol to the building found no sign of anyone wounded. No blood, no bandages, no one making accusations. A body never turned up. Perez returned Siatta’s rifle and reinstated him.",78,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The fighting intensified, along with the frustration. On one mission, the platoon tried to capture a Taliban commander about six miles away. The man escaped. Siatta was so annoyed after listening to a “bullshit speech about even though we found nothing we still came out on top” from Cuomo, the company commander, that he wrote in his journal that he “wanted to punch him in the face.”",79,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Not yet two months into his tour, Siatta was no longer a naïve kid from the prairie. He had hardened, and was both angry and more alert. He was harboring doubts about the war. Marines were doing the most dangerous work and were told that Afghan forces were going to build on their success. After watching the Afghan soldiers his platoon worked with, Siatta was certain that was not going to happen. When he visited them in their tents, he said, “they’d be in there on their rugs, making chai, smoking dope. I’d be like: ‘You guys are fucking turds. We’re here to do shit, and you’re high as fuck.’?” When Marines patrolled, many of the Afghans stayed back.",80,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Once the ambush was broken, First Squad was ordered to sweep a compound from which the Taliban had been firing. A building inside had been hit with two Hellfire missiles. The squad crossed a cold, waist-deep canal and stacked at the entrance. Siatta was on point.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The Marines were grieving, too. Lance Cpl. Nicholas Hand, from First Platoon, had been shot through the head and killed, perhaps by gunfire from that house. Another Marine had been hit in the leg. Kurtz said the platoon already sensed that the plans for Helmand were destined to fail. “It was obvious even then that this wasn’t going to work,” he said. “I think everyone understood that this was just going back to the Taliban again as soon as we leave.” He could see that some of his Marines were having difficulty processing it all. The misdirected carnage, the feeling that their sacrifices and risks were connected to a campaign that could not succeed — all of it, Kurtz said, preyed on their minds.",86,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s breakout moment happened on Nov. 29, as First Squad was attacked while crossing a field. This was by then a familiar event. The squad was spread out, and Siatta and three Marines were separated from most of the others, who took cover by a building and returned fire. Siatta and the exposed team, including Perez, were alone and unprotected. They scrambled for a ditch that was perhaps a foot deep. Bullets thudded all around as they huddled there.",90,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"They reached the broken building. Siatta pressed himself chest down behind a mound of dirt, extended the bipods on his rifle, looked over the top and fired about 10 shots, roughly toward where the gunfire was coming from. Then he did what he had been trained to do. He slowed his breathing. He focused. As the bullets cracked by, he put his eye to the glass and considered his options.

Siatta wasn’t sure of the range, but thought it might be 250 yards. His scope was set for 300. Expecting his bullet to strike slightly high, he rested the cross hairs below the man’s chest, slowly exhaled and eased the trigger back until he felt the rifle’s light kick.",94,2017,Features

It was a short drive, and he would have been the perfect prop: the infantry Marine freshly returned from Obama’s surge. He refused to attend.

He loaded up on tattoos, including a sword-wielding Lady Justice on his chest and abdomen, topped with seven hash marks for men he claimed as kills. The Marines he deployed with were coming of age. There had been little opportunity to spend money in Afghanistan, and many returned with savings. Some bought cars. They were turning 21 and could legally visit bars.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Whether Siatta remembered it or not, he had committed a serious crime. The case gained momentum swiftly. In late April, a grand jury indicted Siatta on charges of home invasion causing harm — a Class X felony, the second-most serious category of crime in the Illinois penal code. The charge carried a mandatory sentence of six to 30 years, putting Siatta’s offense in the same league as aggravated kidnapping or the predatory sexual assault of a child.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The news took time to reach Siatta. That same month, he had entered a residential substance-abuse rehabilitation program at a V.A. hospital west of Chicago, where combat-based PTSD, depressive disorder and alcohol-use disorder were diagnosed. The V.A. prescribed him Xanax and hydroxyzine for anxiety and approved roughly $1,300 a month in disability benefits for service-connected depression and PTSD. Six weeks later, Siatta transferred to a federal health care center in North Chicago for more inpatient counseling.",185,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"When Siatta checked out of the hospital in July, he turned himself in for booking. The evidence against him was strong. His mother retained a private criminal defense lawyer, Hal Jennings, who approached prosecutors about a plea to a lesser felony and a sentence of probation. Siatta had no previous criminal record. The man he had fought had not been seriously hurt. Given Siatta’s combat service and apparent post-combat illness, Jennings considered it a reasonable request. But Kristin Alferink, the assistant state’s attorney handling Siatta’s prosecution, was firm. In September, she offered a plea to the original charge and a 10-year prison term. Jennings rejected it. “I was not under any circumstances going to plead that kid into prison,” he said.",186,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The state’s inflexibility in part reflected the wishes of the man who had fought Siatta. Since the struggle in the kitchen, he had suffered from insomnia and was having difficulties in crowds or when people approached him from behind. “I’m completely paranoid of everything,” he told me. He tried to make his house feel safer, he said, by having it “wired to the gills with security cameras.” He slept with a loaded Walther P38 pistol by his bed. He still found it difficult to relax. “The heater goes off,” he said, “and I jump back five feet.” It was as if some of Siatta’s PTSD symptoms had been transferred to him. He entered therapy and started taking anti-anxiety medication. But he remained angry. He knew little of Siatta’s service in the Marine Corps. It might not have changed his feelings if he did. “He could have been Jesus incarnate,” he said, “and I still would have wanted blood.”",187,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Jennings and a partner, Carey J. Luckman, prepared for trial. They gathered military records and character recommendations from Siatta’s supervisors in the Marines. They also arranged for him to undergo a second psychological evaluation. In May 2015, he was reviewed by Don R. Catherall, a psychologist specializing in trauma disorders and a Marine veteran of Vietnam. Catherall’s report echoed the V.A.’s diagnoses of PTSD and severe alcohol-use disorder, and noted that Siatta had not had a drink in more than a year. This, he wrote, “officially constitutes remission of the substance-use disorder.” He added, “As long as he remains sober, he is unlikely to repeat the behaviors that led to this unfortunate situation.”",188,2017,Features

He did not tell her anything of the home invasion, or that he was awaiting trial.",190,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s prospects for avoiding prison were likely to rise or fall depending on whether a judge and a jury would be willing to view his combat experience, and his self-medicating with alcohol, as factors in the home invasion and fight. In September 2015, Jennings and Alferink, the prosecutor, traveled to North Chicago to depose Sheilah C. Perrin, a psychologist supervising Siatta’s treatment for the V.A. Under questioning by Jennings, Perrin laid out her views, noting that Siatta, who was also present, had entered 30 to 40 compounds containing insurgents. She described common behaviors for veterans with such histories: reclusion, avoiding crowds, unceasing vigilance and using alcohol as a coping technique “to escape from their pain and from their memories.” She listed Siatta’s diagnoses and said that once Siatta entered a strange home and was confronted inside, the knife would have been a “huge, huge, huge trigger.” Her assessment was unambiguous. “He needs treatment,” she said. By the end of the questioning, she had teared up.",191,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Alferink pushed hard, inquiring why Perrin had been “emotional” and asking whether she had the “same empathy and thankfulness” for the man Siatta had fought, who was also a veteran. During a half-hour of often-testy exchanges, Alferink proposed that Siatta’s PTSD was not related to his combat service and suggested that his use of alcohol was “similar to somebody who just broke up with their boyfriend” or “who couldn’t cope with losing a job.”",192,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Jennings still thought he had a strong defense. The character references from Marines were glowing, and he was ready to argue that the fight in the kitchen was a conditioned reflex for a troubled man with Siatta’s combat record.",193,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A few weeks before the trial, Jennings was discussing the case with Siatta’s mother, Maureen, when she mentioned that her son had kept a journal in Afghanistan. Siatta had recently retrieved it from Volk. Jennings asked to see it. It was a small tan notebook on which Siatta had drawn a human skull with a cracked forehead. When Jennings started reading, he could not stop. On Oct. 22, 2015, less than three weeks before the trial, he entered a copy of the journal into the court record. “This is the key,” he told Maureen. “This is what could win your case.”",194,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By then Siatta had graduated from a substance-abuse program and been sober for a year and half. He was in counseling. He suffered from anxiety, but less acutely, allowing him to stop taking Xanax and hydroxyzine. He was exercising, taking up martial arts and weight lifting again. It helped his moods. His relationship with Volk softened his antisocial side. Jennings asked Alferink to read the diary and consider Siatta’s last night of drinking and the home invasion in light of his combat service and PTSD, and his apparent progress since. He hoped the state would consider a better plea deal. “If Sam didn’t have the best mitigation package in the world, who did?” he said.",195,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The trial opened on Nov. 9. Jennings and Luckman hoped the judge would allow jurors to consider Siatta’s actions a result of involuntary intoxication. This defense had precedent in Illinois among defendants who had been drugged by others, but not with defendants trying to drown PTSD with alcohol. The state tried to quash the argument outright. Alferink told the court that “the reason why he consumed the alcohol has nothing to do with this case.” She added: “He could have consumed the alcohol because he was suffering from PTSD and wanted to be able to go to a party. Again, he could have consumed the alcohol because he was trying to get over a breakup, because he just lost a job. The reason for the underlying alcohol consumption does not matter.”",197,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"At each opportunity for sympathy, the state moved against. In jury selection, Alferink asked whether any of the potential jurors had military experience. Two said they did — a former Navy petty officer and a Marine reservist who had been injured in an accident in Afghanistan. Alferink had them excused from serving on the jury. This denied Siatta, in Jennings’s view, a trial by peers. “She excluded the only people who had any chance of understanding this defendant and what he went through,” he said.",198,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s lawyers did not dispute the central facts of the case.

He returned to court and apologized in a statement leaden with resignation. “I have no memory of that night,” he said. “I can’t explain what happened that night. I wish I could. You know, I’m getting treatment for my illness. I think I’m doing better, but I’ve got a long road ahead of me, and that’s all I got.”",206,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The case of the People of the State of Illinois v. Samuel Siatta then took a rare turn. The trial judge, Scott Drazewski, expressed gratitude to the man he was sending away. “Mr. Siatta, as an American citizen, I thank you for your service to your country,” he said. “Your patriotism, your valor, your courage and your heroism — according to those you’ve served with, you were an exceptional soldier who led by example.”",207,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"But Drazewski added that he was hearing the case as a judge, not just a citizen, and because of mandatory-sentencing guidelines he had no option of assigning Siatta to probation. “Although it is with regret,” he said, “I’m still required to follow the law.” He sentenced Siatta to six years in prison, the legal minimum — four years less than the prosecutors had offered in their plea deal.",208,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta passed the next month at the Stateville Correctional Center, awaiting transfer to the prison where he would serve his sentence. Inmates in reception status have few privileges. Siatta was on 24-hour lockdown and received no visitors. His cellblock seemed to him like an enormous warehouse, with inmates in cells stacked upon cells. The air filled with their din.",209,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"During 28 days there, he said, he rarely left his cell. Meals were delivered to the door and eaten inside. Every Tuesday he was allowed out for a shower, in a stall where the water was scalding hot. His cell did not have a window, and the lights were never off. Between the noise and the incessant brightness, he slept fitfully. As he lost his sense of time, he was not sure when he was supposed to rest. He remembers seeing a clock once, during a group orientation. It said 9 a.m. By his estimate, he had eaten breakfast seven hours before. His anxiety rose again, and when he asked for medications, none were provided, he said, though he had a diagnosis and prescriptions from the V.A.",210,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A schedule took shape. He would lie on his bunk until breakfast, then eat and get back on the bunk until lunch. After lunch he would do squats and push-ups, then return to the bunk until dinner. Each day he received a carton of milk. A previous inmate had accumulated enough cartons to make a crude deck of playing cards, which he had left in the cell for others. Siatta did not use them. He felt himself sliding into a mental hibernation. He managed to send Volk a short letter.",211,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I love you so very much my love,” he wrote. “You are my one and only, and I promise. I love you so so so much and we will have a life filled with love and happiness. To my pretty gypsy, from your love, Samuel.”",212,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He didn’t know what else to say. The legal system bewildered him, and he found it hard to think in concrete terms, beyond that he had to leave.",213,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Outside the prison, his new lawyer, Richard Winter, was preparing an appeal. Winter had agreed to represent Siatta in late 2015, between the conviction and the sentencing. A partner at Holland & Knight, an international firm, he specialized in commercial and antitrust litigation from his 30th-floor office in downtown Chicago. He had no experience in criminal law and had taken Siatta as a client via a peculiar impulse. Holland & Knight offers pro bono representation to clients who cannot otherwise afford it. Over the years, Winter had helped autistic children in court fights against school districts in and around Chicago and had worked on Hague Convention cases, trying to reunite children with parents in international custody disputes. In November 2015, he had just read “Rogue Lawyer,” a novel by John Grisham about Sebastian Rudd, a bourbon-drinking, gun-carrying lawyer with a bulletproof van who fights for justice for unappealing clients. Winter was amused by Rudd, a cartoonish figure. He was also impressed by his legal tactics, which he thought were able. Soon after finishing the book, Winter received an officewide email describing Siatta’s case and asking if anyone wanted to step in. He figured this was a case for someone of Rudd’s talents, and it looked interesting on the merits. He volunteered to try.",214,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Two weeks later, he met Siatta and his mother at a rest stop on Interstate 294. Siatta impressed him. He was in his last weeks of freedom before an expected prison term and was on his way home from PTSD counseling. Winter read the case file, looking for a basis for appeal. He attended the sentencing hearing in January and watched his new client depart for prison. The judge allowed Siatta about a minute with his mother, and after he was gone Maureen lingered in the courtroom, then in the hallway. She looked numb. Winter told her, “I’ll see what I can do.”",215,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Winter knew the appeal would consume much of 2016. He also figured that while he might persuade the appellate court to consider a retrial, allowing a judge to instruct jurors to consider an involuntary-intoxication defense, the chances were probably slim. And even if the judges granted a new trial, he knew, Siatta would still need to prevail before a jury, of which there was no guarantee. Winter’s backup plan was to seek a pardon from the Illinois governor after the appeals process was exhausted. Either way, Siatta was not coming home anytime soon.",216,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By March, the state had moved Siatta from Stateville to Shawnee, where inmates lived in two-story X-shaped buildings, called houses, each with a central station from which guards watched over the population. Siatta was assigned to a cell in 4-House. It was a drab and musty place with missing floor tiles, an upper and lower bunk, a toilet and a small steel sink. His cellmate, a moody man with a thin mustache, was doing time for failing to register as a sex offender.",217,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Early each morning, the locks would click open. Inmates could step into the cellblock corridor and file into the darkness and cold for a short walk to the cafeteria for breakfast and a cup of water. The routine was repeated for lunch and dinner. The schedule also allowed for about an hour of “day room” time — to lift weights in the open-air yard, use telephones in a call center or buy food and toiletries in the commissary with money their families added to their prison accounts.",218,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Buying extra food drew attention. In the cash-free ecosystem of prison, purchases became currency. A T-shirt, a coffee cup, a package of cookies — these could be traded or gambled. They also attracted thieves.",219,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The guards tended to cluster in the central section of each house, and they ventured only occasionally into the cellblock corridors. This meant that when the locks were released, there was a moment in which inmates could furtively enter one another’s cells. Siatta returned from one meal to find about $50 worth of food stolen. His cellmate was enraged at the breach of turf. He told other inmates that he would find the thief and punish him.",220,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta had probably seen more violence in his life than anyone else in 4-House. But he understood that fighting as an inmate carried special risks, and not of injury. If the guards discovered a fight, everyone involved could be taken to solitary confinement — called “seg” for “segregation” — and have their prison records marked up. This could prevent an early release. Siatta’s case was on appeal. He could not afford trouble. He tried talking his cellmate down. “I got a lot of stuff going on,” he told him. “I got a good case. I can’t be getting into fights, going to seg, getting new charges over some tuna packet.”",221,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"One day during day-room time, a few gang members appeared in the corridor near their door.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta’s cellmate was left on the floor. He had been beaten badly. He had a gash in his head, which had been slammed against the steel bunk. He was bleeding all over the tiles. Siatta examined the wound and knew it needed medical attention. But the man refused to approach the guards. He told Siatta he would stay in the cell for a few weeks and eat commissary food until the bruises and cuts healed.",225,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The plan did not last long. The guards opened an investigation. Six inmates were sent to seg, Siatta said, including the two who had fought. Siatta was transferred to another house.",226,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"His new cellmate was a member of the Latin Kings; among his many tattoos was the gang’s symbol, a five-point crown. He laid down the rules. “In here, this house, it’s our house, and we’re cool,” he said of their cell. “But out there you are not affiliated, and if you get in trouble I can’t help you.” Siatta left Shawnee for a court appearance related to his appeal and was held at the decrepit Pontiac Correctional Center before returning to Shawnee and a cell with another Latin King. The same code applied: We get along inside the cell. Out there we don’t know each other.",227,2017,Features

He would ask if there was news about his appeal, he said, “and it was always just, ‘No.’?” The counseling he had attended at the V.A. with a therapist who knew him was replaced by a once-a-month, 15-minute mental-health checkup. “It was basically: ‘Do you want to hurt someone? Do you want to hurt yourself?’ and ‘All right, see you next month,’?” he said. Depression gripped him again.",231,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He tried exercising during his yard time, knowing it soothed his symptoms. Some weeks he managed to work out in committed bursts, though three or four inmates were usually lined up at each piece of equipment, waiting a turn.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"In April, as Siatta brooded in prison, I wrote to Scott Drazewski, the judge who had not wanted to send him there. He declined to discuss the case. State rules, he said by email, prohibited judges from commenting on matters under appeal. But after visiting Siatta in Shawnee, I met with Donald D. Bernardi, a retired state judge and former peer of Drazewski’s, who understood how mandatory-sentencing rules had forced Drazewski to incarcerate Siatta.",233,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Bernardi knew the outlines of Siatta’s criminal file. I shared details from his combat tour: the boy shot through the head, the civilians struck by Hellfire missiles, Siatta’s run of methodical killing in late 2009. It was all news to him. We talked about the frustration and anger many combat veterans share as their wars have dragged on with no visible end, and how Siatta’s depression and PTSD were not unusual. We discussed the words of support from Cuomo, Siatta’s former commander. “Having watched and fought, up close and personal, with Mr. Siatta, I remain humbled by his incredibly courageous actions,” he had written. We also talked about the severity of Siatta’s crime. A man of his background smashing into anyone’s home was a frightening prospect.",234,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Bernardi’s reaction surprised me.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The county’s legal circle is small. Bernardi said the elected state’s attorney, Jason Chambers — Alferink’s boss — had practiced in his courtroom early in his career. “He’s a good guy,” he said, a reasonable lawyer who could see more than one side of an issue.",236,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"A few hours later, I met Chambers in his office for a conversation with him and Alferink. We reprised the conversation with Bernardi.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I was in New England two days later when Chambers sent me a text message. He asked for a phone number for Richard Winter, Siatta’s attorney. That afternoon he called Winter and made an unsolicited proposal. He was ready to vacate Siatta’s conviction, he said, and allow him to leave prison and plead to a lesser charge with a sentence of probation. And he was willing to make it easy. He wanted Winter to get documentation from the V.A. confirming that Siatta would be enrolled in mental-health care. Once he had it, the state would ask the appellate court to let Siatta out of Shawnee — immediately. They would work out the new plea deal later.",238,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,Siatta was asleep on his bunk on the afternoon of May 19 when he heard a voice on the intercom saying his door was to be unlocked and he should approach the guards’ station.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Until this point Siatta had little inkling of his shift in fortunes.

The prison officials inventoried his possessions — a hot pot, a few books and magazines, a pair of plastic flip-flops — and handed him an envelope with $63.90 in cash, the balance from his commissary account. Someone gave him a pair of gray sweatpants and a white T-shirt, and Siatta changed out of his prison blues. He kept the white sneakers with his inmate number, Y11107, handwritten on the side.

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"“I am good,” Siatta said. He walked across the lot, past the guards’ cars, with an expressionless face. In the car, he was subdued. He ate a cheeseburger as Taylor tried to explain what just happened. “I had no idea,” Siatta said.",251,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Taylor called Maureen. “We have him,” he said. Maureen had posted his bond in Bloomington and was en route to meet them.

For an hour, he paced between the lobby and Taylor’s room, until Maureen showed up. She and her son walked slowly toward each other and locked in a silent and almost motionless embrace.",255,2017,Features

C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The next day, I met Chambers in a coffee shop. Everyone was surprised by the state’s abrupt change in position. There was a question to explore: Why did Chambers propose exactly the resolution to the case that his office had resisted for two years?",262,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Chambers described a criminal-justice system that resembled an overworked mill. His office handles almost 5,000 cases a year, he said, and it was not possible for him to follow each of them closely, much less read all the case materials. In Siatta’s case, he said, the journal that illuminated his combat history was not available during the plea-negotiation phase. It showed up just before trial.",263,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After we met the first time that spring, he said, he reviewed the file and found the journal. By the time he was done reading, he said, he was not surprised Siatta had ended up in handcuffs. “You take a 19-year-old and you put them in this extreme situation where they are being asked to do things — or maybe not asked, but are choosing to do things — that are contrary to the values they had growing up, and the U.S. government pats your back and says, ‘Good luck,’?” he said. “I don’t see how that is not a recipe for something to go wrong.”",264,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"From his point of view, Chambers said, the plea deal in the works was not actually a large shift. Siatta had received the minimum sentence for a Class-X felony and would soon plead to more than the minimum sentence for a felony one class down. “From a practical standpoint, it is a big change,” he said, because Siatta was out of prison. “From a legal standpoint, it is a hair’s width apart.”",265,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"And for society, Chambers added, the new arrangement was probably safer. If Siatta were to behave well in Shawnee, he would be eligible for release in less than three years and would return with virtually no counseling or care for his PTSD. Now Siatta would be under state supervision for several years, receiving care throughout. “The rationale for me became, ‘What makes people safer over the long term?’?” he said. “Is it treatment or just getting him off the street?”",266,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"The man who had fought Siatta in the house in Normal found that his feelings had changed, too. Though he himself did not serve in combat, the Marine Corps remained central to his life. He served four years as a clerk and was honorably discharged as a noncommissioned officer. G.I. Bill benefits helped underwrite his college studies, and his brother was on active duty. Having been sequestered as a witness during the trial, he did not hear details of Siatta’s combat tour until January, at sentencing, and as he learned more he came to see Siatta as a drunken Marine who did something stupid. The home invasion was not personal. “At the end of the day, it was just a random act,” he said. When Chambers called him in the late spring to discuss vacating Siatta’s conviction, he listened to the prosecutor’s new proposal. After he thought about it, he told me: “I wasn’t angry anymore. I was ready to put it past me and to forgive.”",267,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"After talking with Volk on the phone to tell her he had been released, Siatta went with his brother to a Target to replace his prison sneakers. Whether it was the sudden change from Shawnee to the big box store or the effect of the food, caffeine and nicotine he had consumed, he was overwhelmed. He vomited. The next day he registered with the bond office in Bloomington, and in the summer he appeared in court and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, attempted home invasion, and began four years of probation with weekly counseling at the V.A.",268,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"He felt sluggish. He did little more in the first weeks than visit Volk and go to the gym. “His energy level was way down,” she said. Volk was struggling as well. The months Siatta spent in Shawnee, Volk said, had passed for her in gray procession. Every day was tasteless and colorless. But she understood that Siatta had it worse. Now that he was back, she was patient, willing to let therapy have its effects and allowing him to set his own pace. She was thrilled by his shift in fortune — “when I saw him, it was like being reborn,” she said — but was not expecting a fairy tale. When he seemed withdrawn, she invited him to walk. “We took the dogs around the block,” she said. “The next time, we walked a few more blocks.”",269,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"By the fall, Siatta was making his appointments, in good standing with his probation officer and going out more. He was physically fit. The V.A. reduced his disability rating from 70 percent to 50 percent — a shift suggesting that doctors there felt his PTSD had less of a hold on him. When I visited him in late November, we ate three meals together in restaurants over four days. Each time he was amiable with the staff and did not appear vigilant. Twice he sat with his back to the door. He had not had a drink in almost two and a half years. His eyes seemed bright, his voice light, his demeanor relaxed. He was also looking for a job, although it was hard as a felon on probation to get past a background check. He was almost hired by a moving company, he said, until he told the supervisor of his conviction. He had not given up. Volk thought she might soon have something lined up for him to check IDs at the door of the sports bar where she worked.",270,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"While he waited, he was splitting time between his mother’s home and Volk’s place, and speaking of marriage. Volk knew where he had been and what he had done, and she accepted it all. Familiarity, Siatta suggested, was relief. “Explaining is exhausting,” he said, “and we’ve got most of it done.”",271,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"One morning after meeting his probation officer, Siatta was in the basement of his mother’s house, hitting a heavy bag. Upstairs in a scrapbook were photographs of his life, including one taken days before he left home for the Marines, when his recruiter had brought the family a cake. He was a shy kid with acne and muscular arms, able to do 28 pull-ups even before arriving at boot camp. He did not look much older now, in the basement, working the hanging bag. He had wrapped his hands with tape. His legs and feet were bare. Sweat beaded on his shoulders. The air carried the smack of each impact, followed by a pause. He was striking the bag steadily, resisting the urge to acknowledge the sharp pulsating in his hands as he tried to build pain tolerance and toughen his fists. “You don’t want to break your hand on someone’s face,” he said.",272,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"Siatta was training to make an amateur mixed-martial-arts fight card and break into the Midwestern club-fighting scene. His regimen included sparring with a police-officer friend. He had only one problem so far. He lacked full control of his left arm. The stab wounds, it seemed, had caused nerve damage. He jabbed the bag with his left hand — thwack — and frowned. “It feels off, my hand-eye coordination, almost like my targeting system has been severed,” he said.",273,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"I asked him whether entering the ring with one good arm to exchange blows with a trained fighter carried more risks than he might want, especially considering the delicate platinum coils in his neck that could be dislodged. He seemed tired of the question. It was the type of discouragement he had heard since telling friends he was enlisting in the Marines. “If my dream was to be a lawyer or doctor, something that was socially acceptable, then everybody would be happy,” he said. “But when I tell people I want to be a fighter, they are like, ‘Ooh, you’re going to fuck yourself.’?”",274,2017,Features
C.J. Chivers,2016-12-28,The Fighter,"People warn him that he is going to get hurt, he said, and “I’m like, ‘Well, it is fighting, so that’s almost a definite.’?” He hoped to earn enough money to pay the hospital bills.

Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"When the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck Tohoku, Japan, Chris Goldfinger was two hundred miles away, in the city of Kashiwa, at an international meeting on seismology. As the shaking started, everyone in the room began to laugh. Earthquakes are common in Japan—that one was the third of the week—and the participants were, after all, at a seismology conference. Then everyone in the room checked the time.",1,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Seismologists know that how long an earthquake lasts is a decent proxy for its magnitude. The 1989 earthquake in Loma Prieta, California, which killed sixty-three people and caused six billion dollars’ worth of damage, lasted about fifteen seconds and had a magnitude of 6.9. A thirty-second earthquake generally has a magnitude in the mid-sevens. A minute-long quake is in the high sevens, a two-minute quake has entered the eights, and a three-minute quake is in the high eights. By four minutes, an earthquake has hit magnitude 9.0.",2,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"When Goldfinger looked at his watch, it was quarter to three. The conference was wrapping up for the day. He was thinking about sushi. The speaker at the lectern was wondering if he should carry on with his talk. The earthquake was not particularly strong. Then it ticked past the sixty-second mark, making it longer than the others that week. The shaking intensified. The seats in the conference room were small plastic desks with wheels. Goldfinger, who is tall and solidly built, thought, No way am I crouching under one of those for cover. At a minute and a half, everyone in the room got up and went outside.",3,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"It was March. There was a chill in the air, and snow flurries, but no snow on the ground. Nor, from the feel of it, was there ground on the ground. The earth snapped and popped and rippled. It was, Goldfinger thought, like driving through rocky terrain in a vehicle with no shocks, if both the vehicle and the terrain were also on a raft in high seas. The quake passed the two-minute mark. The trees, still hung with the previous autumn’s dead leaves, were making a strange rattling sound. The flagpole atop the building he and his colleagues had just vacated was whipping through an arc of forty degrees. The building itself was base-isolated, a seismic-safety technology in which the body of a structure rests on movable bearings rather than directly on its foundation. Goldfinger lurched over to take a look. The base was lurching, too, back and forth a foot at a time, digging a trench in the yard. He thought better of it, and lurched away. His watch swept past the three-minute mark and kept going.",4,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Oh, shit, Goldfinger thought, although not in dread, at first: in amazement. For decades, seismologists had believed that Japan could not experience an earthquake stronger than magnitude 8.4. In 2005, however, at a conference in Hokudan, a Japanese geologist named Yasutaka Ikeda had argued that the nation should expect a magnitude 9.0 in the near future—with catastrophic consequences, because Japan’s famous earthquake-and-tsunami preparedness, including the height of its sea walls, was based on incorrect science. The presentation was met with polite applause and thereafter largely ignored. Now, Goldfinger realized as the shaking hit the four-minute mark, the planet was proving the Japanese Cassandra right.",5,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"For a moment, that was pretty cool: a real-time revolution in earthquake science. Almost immediately, though, it became extremely uncool, because Goldfinger and every other seismologist standing outside in Kashiwa knew what was coming. One of them pulled out a cell phone and started streaming videos from the Japanese broadcasting station NHK, shot by helicopters that had flown out to sea soon after the shaking started. Thirty minutes after Goldfinger first stepped outside, he watched the tsunami roll in, in real time, on a two-inch screen.",6,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In the end, the magnitude-9.0 Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed more than eighteen thousand people, devastated northeast Japan, triggered the meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, and cost an estimated two hundred and twenty billion dollars. The shaking earlier in the week turned out to be the foreshocks of the largest earthquake in the nation’s recorded history. But for Chris Goldfinger, a paleoseismologist at Oregon State University and one of the world’s leading experts on a little-known fault line, the main quake was itself a kind of foreshock: a preview of another earthquake still to come.",7,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Most people in the United States know just one fault line by name: the San Andreas, which runs nearly the length of California and is perpetually rumored to be on the verge of unleashing “the big one.” That rumor is misleading, no matter what the San Andreas ever does. Every fault line has an upper limit to its potency, determined by its length and width, and by how far it can slip. For the San Andreas, one of the most extensively studied and best understood fault lines in the world, that upper limit is roughly an 8.2—a powerful earthquake, but, because the Richter scale is logarithmic, only six per cent as strong as the 2011 event in Japan.",8,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Just north of the San Andreas, however, lies another fault line. Known as the Cascadia subduction zone, it runs for seven hundred miles off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, beginning near Cape Mendocino, California, continuing along Oregon and Washington, and terminating around Vancouver Island, Canada. The “Cascadia” part of its name comes from the Cascade Range, a chain of volcanic mountains that follow the same course a hundred or so miles inland. The “subduction zone” part refers to a region of the planet where one tectonic plate is sliding underneath (subducting) another. Tectonic plates are those slabs of mantle and crust that, in their epochs-long drift, rearrange the earth’s continents and oceans. Most of the time, their movement is slow, harmless, and all but undetectable. Occasionally, at the borders where they meet, it is not.",9,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Take your hands and hold them palms down, middle fingertips touching. Your right hand represents the North American tectonic plate, which bears on its back, among other things, our entire continent, from One World Trade Center to the Space Needle, in Seattle. Your left hand represents an oceanic plate called Juan de Fuca, ninety thousand square miles in size. The place where they meet is the Cascadia subduction zone. Now slide your left hand under your right one. That is what the Juan de Fuca plate is doing: slipping steadily beneath North America. When you try it, your right hand will slide up your left arm, as if you were pushing up your sleeve. That is what North America is not doing. It is stuck, wedged tight against the surface of the other plate.",10,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Without moving your hands, curl your right knuckles up, so that they point toward the ceiling. Under pressure from Juan de Fuca, the stuck edge of North America is bulging upward and compressing eastward, at the rate of, respectively, three to four millimetres and thirty to forty millimetres a year. It can do so for quite some time, because, as continent stuff goes, it is young, made of rock that is still relatively elastic. (Rocks, like us, get stiffer as they age.) But it cannot do so indefinitely. There is a backstop—the craton, that ancient unbudgeable mass at the center of the continent—and, sooner or later, North America will rebound like a spring. If, on that occasion, only the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone gives way—your first two fingers, say—the magnitude of the resulting quake will be somewhere between 8.0 and 8.6. That’s the big one. If the entire zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2. That’s the very big one.",11,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Flick your right fingers outward, forcefully, so that your hand flattens back down again. When the next very big earthquake hits, the northwest edge of the continent, from California to Canada and the continental shelf to the Cascades, will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a hundred feet to the west—losing, within minutes, all the elevation and compression it has gained over centuries. Some of that shift will take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of seawater. (Watch what your fingertips do when you flatten your hand.) The water will surge upward into a huge hill, then promptly collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other side will rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will reach the Northwest coast, on average, fifteen minutes after the earthquake begins. By the time the shaking has ceased and the tsunami has receded, the region will be unrecognizable. Kenneth Murphy, who directs FEMA’s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, “Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.”",12,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In the Pacific Northwest, the area of impact will cover* some hundred and forty thousand square miles, including Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Eugene, Salem (the capital city of Oregon), Olympia (the capital of Washington), and some seven million people. When the next full-margin rupture happens, that region will suffer the worst natural disaster in the history of North America. Roughly three thousand people died in San Francisco’s 1906 earthquake. Almost two thousand died in Hurricane Katrina. Almost three hundred died in Hurricane Sandy. FEMA projects that nearly thirteen thousand people will die in the Cascadia earthquake and tsunami. Another twenty-seven thousand will be injured, and the agency expects that it will need to provide shelter for a million displaced people, and food and water for another two and a half million. “This is one time that I’m hoping all the science is wrong, and it won’t happen for another thousand years,” Murphy says.",13,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In fact, the science is robust, and one of the chief scientists behind it is Chris Goldfinger. Thanks to work done by him and his colleagues, we now know that the odds of the big Cascadia earthquake happening in the next fifty years are roughly one in three. The odds of the very big one are roughly one in ten. Even those numbers do not fully reflect the danger—or, more to the point, how unprepared the Pacific Northwest is to face it. The truly worrisome figures in this story are these: Thirty years ago, no one knew that the Cascadia subduction zone had ever produced a major earthquake. Forty-five years ago, no one even knew it existed.",14,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"May of 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, together with their Corps of Discovery, set off from St. Louis on America’s first official cross-country expedition. Eighteen months later, they reached the Pacific Ocean and made camp near the present-day town of Astoria, Oregon. The United States was, at the time, twenty-nine years old. Canada was not yet a country. The continent’s far expanses were so unknown to its white explorers that Thomas Jefferson, who commissioned the journey, thought that the men would come across woolly mammoths. Native Americans had lived in the Northwest for millennia, but they had no written language, and the many things to which the arriving Europeans subjected them did not include seismological inquiries. The newcomers took the land they encountered at face value, and at face value it was a find: vast, cheap, temperate, fertile, and, to all appearances, remarkably benign.",15,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"A century and a half elapsed before anyone had any inkling that the Pacific Northwest was not a quiet place but a place in a long period of quiet. It took another fifty years to uncover and interpret the region’s seismic history. Geology, as even geologists will tell you, is not normally the sexiest of disciplines; it hunkers down with earthly stuff while the glory accrues to the human and the cosmic—to genetics, neuroscience, physics. But, sooner or later, every field has its field day, and the discovery of the Cascadia subduction zone stands as one of the greatest scientific detective stories of our time.",16,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The first clue came from geography. Almost all of the world’s most powerful earthquakes occur in the Ring of Fire, the volcanically and seismically volatile swath of the Pacific that runs from New Zealand up through Indonesia and Japan, across the ocean to Alaska, and down the west coast of the Americas to Chile. Japan, 2011, magnitude 9.0; Indonesia, 2004, magnitude 9.1; Alaska, 1964, magnitude 9.2; Chile, 1960, magnitude 9.5—not until the late nineteen-sixties, with the rise of the theory of plate tectonics, could geologists explain this pattern. The Ring of Fire, it turns out, is really a ring of subduction zones. Nearly all the earthquakes in the region are caused by continental plates getting stuck on oceanic plates—as North America is stuck on Juan de Fuca—and then getting abruptly unstuck. And nearly all the volcanoes are caused by the oceanic plates sliding deep beneath the continental ones, eventually reaching temperatures and pressures so extreme that they melt the rock above them.",17,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The Pacific Northwest sits squarely within the Ring of Fire. Off its coast, an oceanic plate is slipping beneath a continental one. Inland, the Cascade volcanoes mark the line where, far below, the Juan de Fuca plate is heating up and melting everything above it. In other words, the Cascadia subduction zone has, as Goldfinger put it, “all the right anatomical parts.” Yet not once in recorded history has it caused a major earthquake—or, for that matter, any quake to speak of. By contrast, other subduction zones produce major earthquakes occasionally and minor ones all the time: magnitude 5.0, magnitude 4.0, magnitude why are the neighbors moving their sofa at midnight. You can scarcely spend a week in Japan without feeling this sort of earthquake. You can spend a lifetime in many parts of the Northwest—several, in fact, if you had them to spend—and not feel so much as a quiver. The question facing geologists in the nineteen-seventies was whether the Cascadia subduction zone had ever broken its eerie silence.",18,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In the late nineteen-eighties, Brian Atwater, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, and a graduate student named David Yamaguchi found the answer, and another major clue in the Cascadia puzzle. Their discovery is best illustrated in a place called the ghost forest, a grove of western red cedars on the banks of the Copalis River, near the Washington coast. When I paddled out to it last summer, with Atwater and Yamaguchi, it was easy to see how it got its name. The cedars are spread out across a low salt marsh on a wide northern bend in the river, long dead but still standing. Leafless, branchless, barkless, they are reduced to their trunks and worn to a smooth silver-gray, as if they had always carried their own tombstones inside them.",19,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"What killed the trees in the ghost forest was saltwater. It had long been assumed that they died slowly, as the sea level around them gradually rose and submerged their roots. But, by 1987, Atwater, who had found in soil layers evidence of sudden land subsidence along the Washington coast, suspected that that was backward—that the trees had died quickly when the ground beneath them plummeted. To find out, he teamed up with Yamaguchi, a specialist in dendrochronology, the study of growth-ring patterns in trees. Yamaguchi took samples of the cedars and found that they had died simultaneously: in tree after tree, the final rings dated to the summer of 1699. Since trees do not grow in the winter, he and Atwater concluded that sometime between August of 1699 and May of 1700 an earthquake had caused the land to drop and killed the cedars. That time frame predated by more than a hundred years the written history of the Pacific Northwest—and so, by rights, the detective story should have ended there.",20,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"But it did not. If you travel five thousand miles due west from the ghost forest, you reach the northeast coast of Japan. As the events of 2011 made clear, that coast is vulnerable to tsunamis, and the Japanese have kept track of them since at least 599 A.D. In that fourteen-hundred-year history, one incident has long stood out for its strangeness. On the eighth day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of the Genroku era, a six-hundred-mile-long wave struck the coast, levelling homes, breaching a castle moat, and causing an accident at sea. The Japanese understood that tsunamis were the result of earthquakes, yet no one felt the ground shake before the Genroku event. The wave had no discernible origin. When scientists began studying it, they called it an orphan tsunami.",21,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Finally, in a 1996 article in Nature, a seismologist named Kenji Satake and three colleagues, drawing on the work of Atwater and Yamaguchi, matched that orphan to its parent—and thereby filled in the blanks in the Cascadia story with uncanny specificity. At approximately nine o’ clock at night on January 26, 1700, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck the Pacific Northwest, causing sudden land subsidence, drowning coastal forests, and, out in the ocean, lifting up a wave half the length of a continent. It took roughly fifteen minutes for the Eastern half of that wave to strike the Northwest coast. It took ten hours for the other half to cross the ocean. It reached Japan on January 27, 1700: by the local calendar, the eighth day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of Genroku.",22,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Once scientists had reconstructed the 1700 earthquake, certain previously overlooked accounts also came to seem like clues. In 1964, Chief Louis Nookmis, of the Huu-ay-aht First Nation, in British Columbia, told a story, passed down through seven generations, about the eradication of Vancouver Island’s Pachena Bay people. “I think it was at nighttime that the land shook,” Nookmis recalled. According to another tribal history, “They sank at once, were all drowned; not one survived.” A hundred years earlier, Billy Balch, a leader of the Makah tribe, recounted a similar story. Before his own time, he said, all the water had receded from Washington State’s Neah Bay, then suddenly poured back in, inundating the entire region. Those who survived later found canoes hanging from the trees. In a 2005 study, Ruth Ludwin, then a seismologist at the University of Washington, together with nine colleagues, collected and analyzed Native American reports of earthquakes and saltwater floods. Some of those reports contained enough information to estimate a date range for the events they described. On average, the midpoint of that range was 1701.",23,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"It does not speak well of European-Americans that such stories counted as evidence for a proposition only after that proposition had been proved. Still, the reconstruction of the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 is one of those rare natural puzzles whose pieces fit together as tectonic plates do not: perfectly. It is wonderful science. It was wonderful for science. And it was terrible news for the millions of inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest. As Goldfinger put it, “In the late eighties and early nineties, the paradigm shifted to ‘uh-oh.’ ”",24,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Goldfinger told me this in his lab at Oregon State, a low prefab building that a passing English major might reasonably mistake for the maintenance department. Inside the lab is a walk-in freezer. Inside the freezer are floor-to-ceiling racks filled with cryptically labelled tubes, four inches in diameter and five feet long. Each tube contains a core sample of the seafloor. Each sample contains the history, written in seafloorese, of the past ten thousand years. During subduction-zone earthquakes, torrents of land rush off the continental slope, leaving a permanent deposit on the bottom of the ocean. By counting the number and the size of deposits in each sample, then comparing their extent and consistency along the length of the Cascadia subduction zone, Goldfinger and his colleagues were able to determine how much of the zone has ruptured, how often, and how drastically.",25,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Thanks to that work, we now know that the Pacific Northwest has experienced forty-one subduction-zone earthquakes in the past ten thousand years. If you divide ten thousand by forty-one, you get two hundred and forty-three, which is Cascadia’s recurrence interval: the average amount of time that elapses between earthquakes. That timespan is dangerous both because it is too long—long enough for us to unwittingly build an entire civilization on top of our continent’s worst fault line—and because it is not long enough. Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a two-hundred-and-forty-three-year cycle.",26,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"It is possible to quibble with that number. Recurrence intervals are averages, and averages are tricky: ten is the average of nine and eleven, but also of eighteen and two. It is not possible, however, to dispute the scale of the problem. The devastation in Japan in 2011 was the result of a discrepancy between what the best science predicted and what the region was prepared to withstand. The same will hold true in the Pacific Northwest—but here the discrepancy is enormous. “The science part is fun,” Goldfinger says. “And I love doing it. But the gap between what we know and what we should do about it is getting bigger and bigger, and the action really needs to turn to responding. Otherwise, we’re going to be hammered. I’ve been through one of these massive earthquakes in the most seismically prepared nation on earth. If that was Portland”—Goldfinger finished the sentence with a shake of his head before he finished it with words. “Let’s just say I would rather not be here.”",27,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The first sign that the Cascadia earthquake has begun will be a compressional wave, radiating outward from the fault line. Compressional waves are fast-moving, high-frequency waves, audible to dogs and certain other animals but experienced by humans only as a sudden jolt. They are not very harmful, but they are potentially very useful, since they travel fast enough to be detected by sensors thirty to ninety seconds ahead of other seismic waves. That is enough time for earthquake early-warning systems, such as those in use throughout Japan, to automatically perform a variety of lifesaving functions: shutting down railways and power plants, opening elevators and firehouse doors, alerting hospitals to halt surgeries, and triggering alarms so that the general public can take cover. The Pacific Northwest has no early-warning system. When the Cascadia earthquake begins, there will be, instead, a cacophony of barking dogs and a long, suspended, what-was-that moment before the surface waves arrive. Surface waves are slower, lower-frequency waves that move the ground both up and down and side to side: the shaking, starting in earnest.",28,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Soon after that shaking begins, the electrical grid will fail, likely everywhere west of the Cascades and possibly well beyond. If it happens at night, the ensuing catastrophe will unfold in darkness. In theory, those who are at home when it hits should be safest; it is easy and relatively inexpensive to seismically safeguard a private dwelling. But, lulled into nonchalance by their seemingly benign environment, most people in the Pacific Northwest have not done so. That nonchalance will shatter instantly. So will everything made of glass. Anything indoors and unsecured will lurch across the floor or come crashing down: bookshelves, lamps, computers, cannisters of flour in the pantry. Refrigerators will walk out of kitchens, unplugging themselves and toppling over. Water heaters will fall and smash interior gas lines. Houses that are not bolted to their foundations will slide off—or, rather, they will stay put, obeying inertia, while the foundations, together with the rest of the Northwest, jolt westward. Unmoored on the undulating ground, the homes will begin to collapse.",29,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Across the region, other, larger structures will also start to fail. Until 1974, the state of Oregon had no seismic code, and few places in the Pacific Northwest had one appropriate to a magnitude-9.0 earthquake until 1994. The vast majority of buildings in the region were constructed before then. Ian Madin, who directs the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI), estimates that seventy-five per cent of all structures in the state are not designed to withstand a major Cascadia quake. FEMA calculates that, across the region, something on the order of a million buildings—more than three thousand of them schools—will collapse or be compromised in the earthquake. So will half of all highway bridges, fifteen of the seventeen bridges spanning Portland’s two rivers, and two-thirds of railways and airports; also, one-third of all fire stations, half of all police stations, and two-thirds of all hospitals.",30,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Certain disasters stem from many small problems conspiring to cause one very large problem. For want of a nail, the war was lost; for fifteen independently insignificant errors, the jetliner was lost. Subduction-zone earthquakes operate on the opposite principle: one enormous problem causes many other enormous problems. The shaking from the Cascadia quake will set off landslides throughout the region—up to thirty thousand of them in Seattle alone, the city’s emergency-management office estimates. It will also induce a process called liquefaction, whereby seemingly solid ground starts behaving like a liquid, to the detriment of anything on top of it. Fifteen per cent of Seattle is built on liquefiable land, including seventeen day-care centers and the homes of some thirty-four thousand five hundred people. So is Oregon’s critical energy-infrastructure hub, a six-mile stretch of Portland through which flows ninety per cent of the state’s liquid fuel and which houses everything from electrical substations to natural-gas terminals. Together, the sloshing, sliding, and shaking will trigger fires, flooding, pipe failures, dam breaches, and hazardous-material spills. Any one of these second-order disasters could swamp the original earthquake in terms of cost, damage, or casualties—and one of them definitely will. Four to six minutes after the dogs start barking, the shaking will subside. For another few minutes, the region, upended, will continue to fall apart on its own. Then the wave will arrive, and the real destruction will begin.",31,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Among natural disasters, tsunamis may be the closest to being completely unsurvivable. The only likely way to outlive one is not to be there when it happens: to steer clear of the vulnerable area in the first place, or get yourself to high ground as fast as possible. For the seventy-one thousand people who live in Cascadia’s inundation zone, that will mean evacuating in the narrow window after one disaster ends and before another begins. They will be notified to do so only by the earthquake itself—“a vibrate-alert system,” Kevin Cupples, the city planner for the town of Seaside, Oregon, jokes—and they are urged to leave on foot, since the earthquake will render roads impassable. Depending on location, they will have between ten and thirty minutes to get out. That time line does not allow for finding a flashlight, tending to an earthquake injury, hesitating amid the ruins of a home, searching for loved ones, or being a Good Samaritan. “When that tsunami is coming, you run,” Jay Wilson, the chair of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission (OSSPAC), says. “You protect yourself, you don’t turn around, you don’t go back to save anybody. You run for your life.”",32,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The time to save people from a tsunami is before it happens, but the region has not yet taken serious steps toward doing so. Hotels and businesses are not required to post evacuation routes or to provide employees with evacuation training. In Oregon, it has been illegal since 1995 to build hospitals, schools, firehouses, and police stations in the inundation zone, but those which are already in it can stay, and any other new construction is permissible: energy facilities, hotels, retirement homes. In those cases, builders are required only to consult with DOGAMI about evacuation plans. “So you come in and sit down,” Ian Madin says. “And I say, ‘That’s a stupid idea.’ And you say, ‘Thanks. Now we’ve consulted.’ ”",33,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"These lax safety policies guarantee that many people inside the inundation zone will not get out. Twenty-two per cent of Oregon’s coastal population is sixty-five or older. Twenty-nine per cent of the state’s population is disabled, and that figure rises in many coastal counties. “We can’t save them,” Kevin Cupples says. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it and say, ‘Oh, yeah, we’ll go around and check on the elderly.’ No. We won’t.” Nor will anyone save the tourists. Washington State Park properties within the inundation zone see an average of seventeen thousand and twenty-nine guests a day. Madin estimates that up to a hundred and fifty thousand people visit Oregon’s beaches on summer weekends. “Most of them won’t have a clue as to how to evacuate,” he says. “And the beaches are the hardest place to evacuate from.”",34,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Those who cannot get out of the inundation zone under their own power will quickly be overtaken by a greater one. A grown man is knocked over by ankle-deep water moving at 6.7 miles an hour. The tsunami will be moving more than twice that fast when it arrives. Its height will vary with the contours of the coast, from twenty feet to more than a hundred feet. It will not look like a Hokusai-style wave, rising up from the surface of the sea and breaking from above. It will look like the whole ocean, elevated, overtaking land. Nor will it be made only of water—not once it reaches the shore. It will be a five-story deluge of pickup trucks and doorframes and cinder blocks and fishing boats and utility poles and everything else that once constituted the coastal towns of the Pacific Northwest.",35,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"To see the full scale of the devastation when that tsunami recedes, you would need to be in the international space station. The inundation zone will be scoured of structures from California to Canada. The earthquake will have wrought its worst havoc west of the Cascades but caused damage as far away as Sacramento, California—as distant from the worst-hit areas as Fort Wayne, Indiana, is from New York. FEMA expects to coördinate search-and-rescue operations across a hundred thousand square miles and in the waters off four hundred and fifty-three miles of coastline. As for casualties: the figures I cited earlier—twenty-seven thousand injured, almost thirteen thousand dead—are based on the agency’s official planning scenario, which has the earthquake striking at 9:41 A.M. on February 6th. If, instead, it strikes in the summer, when the beaches are full, those numbers could be off by a horrifying margin.",36,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Wineglasses, antique vases, Humpty Dumpty, hip bones, hearts: what breaks quickly generally mends slowly, if at all. OSSPAC estimates that in the I-5 corridor it will take between one and three months after the earthquake to restore electricity, a month to a year to restore drinking water and sewer service, six months to a year to restore major highways, and eighteen months to restore health-care facilities. On the coast, those numbers go up. Whoever chooses or has no choice but to stay there will spend three to six months without electricity, one to three years without drinking water and sewage systems, and three or more years without hospitals. Those estimates do not apply to the tsunami-inundation zone, which will remain all but uninhabitable for years.",37,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"How much all this will cost is anyone’s guess; FEMA puts every number on its relief-and-recovery plan except a price. But whatever the ultimate figure—and even though U.S. taxpayers will cover seventy-five to a hundred per cent of the damage, as happens in declared disasters—the economy of the Pacific Northwest will collapse. Crippled by a lack of basic services, businesses will fail or move away. Many residents will flee as well. OSSPAC predicts a mass-displacement event and a long-term population downturn. Chris Goldfinger didn’t want to be there when it happened. But, by many metrics, it will be as bad or worse to be there afterward.",38,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"On the face of it, earthquakes seem to present us with problems of space: the way we live along fault lines, in brick buildings, in homes made valuable by their proximity to the sea. But, covertly, they also present us with problems of time. The earth is 4.5 billion years old, but we are a young species, relatively speaking, with an average individual allotment of three score years and ten. The brevity of our lives breeds a kind of temporal parochialism—an ignorance of or an indifference to those planetary gears which turn more slowly than our own.",39,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"This problem is bidirectional. The Cascadia subduction zone remained hidden from us for so long because we could not see deep enough into the past. It poses a danger to us today because we have not thought deeply enough about the future. That is no longer a problem of information; we now understand very well what the Cascadia fault line will someday do. Nor is it a problem of imagination. If you are so inclined, you can watch an earthquake destroy much of the West Coast this summer in Brad Peyton’s “San Andreas,” while, in neighboring theatres, the world threatens to succumb to Armageddon by other means: viruses, robots, resource scarcity, zombies, aliens, plague. As those movies attest, we excel at imagining future scenarios, including awful ones. But such apocalyptic visions are a form of escapism, not a moral summons, and still less a plan of action. Where we stumble is in conjuring up grim futures in a way that helps to avert them.",40,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"That problem is not specific to earthquakes, of course. The Cascadia situation, a calamity in its own right, is also a parable for this age of ecological reckoning, and the questions it raises are ones that we all now face. How should a society respond to a looming crisis of uncertain timing but of catastrophic proportions? How can it begin to right itself when its entire infrastructure and culture developed in a way that leaves it profoundly vulnerable to natural disaster?",41,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"The last person I met with in the Pacific Northwest was Doug Dougherty, the superintendent of schools for Seaside, which lies almost entirely within the tsunami-inundation zone. Of the four schools that Dougherty oversees, with a total student population of sixteen hundred, one is relatively safe. The others sit five to fifteen feet above sea level. When the tsunami comes, they will be as much as forty-five feet below it.",42,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"In 2009, Dougherty told me, he found some land for sale outside the inundation zone, and proposed building a new K-12 campus there. Four years later, to foot the hundred-and-twenty-eight-million-dollar bill, the district put up a bond measure. The tax increase for residents amounted to two dollars and sixteen cents per thousand dollars of property value. The measure failed by sixty-two per cent. Dougherty tried seeking help from Oregon’s congressional delegation but came up empty. The state makes money available for seismic upgrades, but buildings within the inundation zone cannot apply. At present, all Dougherty can do is make sure that his students know how to evacuate.",43,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Some of them, however, will not be able to do so. At an elementary school in the community of Gearhart, the children will be trapped. “They can’t make it out from that school,” Dougherty said. “They have no place to go.” On one side lies the ocean; on the other, a wide, roadless bog. When the tsunami comes, the only place to go in Gearhart is a small ridge just behind the school. At its tallest, it is forty-five feet high—lower than the expected wave in a full-margin earthquake. For now, the route to the ridge is marked by signs that say “Temporary Tsunami Assembly Area.” I asked Dougherty about the state’s long-range plan. “There is no long-range plan,” he said.",44,2016,Features
Kathryn Schulz,2015-07-20,The Really Big One,"Dougherty’s office is deep inside the inundation zone, a few blocks from the beach. All day long, just out of sight, the ocean rises up and collapses, spilling foamy overlapping ovals onto the shore. Eighty miles farther out, ten thousand feet below the surface of the sea, the hand of a geological clock is somewhere in its slow sweep. All across the region, seismologists are looking at their watches, wondering how long we have, and what we will do, before geological time catches up to our own.",45,2016,Features

Its slopes, mostly from 40 to 45 degrees, are optimal for avalanches — flat enough to hold deep reservoirs of snow, yet steep enough for the snow to slide long distances when prompted. The long elevation drop means snow can be fluffy at the top and slushy at the bottom.

John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"Ski areas that once vigilantly policed their boundaries, from Jackson Hole, Wyo., to Squaw Valley, Calif., have gradually opened their gates to the territory surrounding them.

They really cannot keep people from going there.",172,2013,Features
John Branch,2012-12-23,Snow Fall,"But ski areas also see the potential to attract more ticket-buying customers, and more influential ones, by blurring the boundary lines.

Intermediate powder skiers have been turned into expert ones thanks to fatter skis and the “rocker” shape of their tips — design advances borrowed from snowboarding.

You must know what he took from us. This happened.",12,2012,Features
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The woman, now 38—out of respect for her wishes, The Stranger is not publishing her name—held the room with a transfixing emotional frankness. She cried at times. She set her jaw and pressed on when it got exhausting, the reliving of an ordeal that probably lasted around 90 minutes, but took close to six hours over two days to retell in court. She showed regret and terror and humiliation and grief and fury. She showed that she appreciated how awful, really absurdly awful, this all was, and she welcomed opportunities to laugh—at herself, at odd things her murdered partner had done when she was alive, at an inelegant, unintentionally impolite question from the prosecuting attorney about a trip she’d made to Weight Watchers with her partner on their last morning together as part of the couple’s plan to get in better shape before their commitment ceremony.",13,2012,Features
Eli Sanders,2011-06-15,The Bravest Woman in Seattle,"The prosecuting attorney asked something like: How’d it go at Weight Watchers? Without missing a beat, without shame, she framed her body with her hands, moved them up and down, and said: “Well…”",14,2012,Features

Laugh at the awkwardness of this, as everyone in the courtroom is doing right now, if that’s what you all need to do. It’s okay. Really. Look at me. And thank you for looking, because later on in this trial, the prosecutor will step up to the witness stand and pull my straight black hair back from my neck so that I can more easily point out, for all of you who are looking, the four slashing scars that run from below my left ear toward my throat, the scars from when the man cut and stabbed me with his knife.

They sat in the backyard of the little red house, staring at the trees, the community center, the sky above. “It was really hot that night,” Butz’s partner recalled on the stand. “Probably like in the 80s or 90s.” They drank.

It sounded like Butz’s mom, who is Catholic and had some reservations about their commitment ceremony, would indeed be coming. “While they may not have agreed with our choice,” Butz’s partner said on the stand of some members of her partner’s family, “there was no question that they loved Teresa, and there was no question that they loved me.”",27,2012,Features

One thought: If this woman can absorb, at the level of detail required for proof before a jury, the particulars of what happened to her daughter—can view the bloody crimescene photographs, can listen to the 911 call from a neighbor leaning over her blood-soaked daughter and screaming, “Ma’am, please wake up! Please wake up!” (while, to the 911 operator pleading, “Please hurry, please hurry”), can hear the testimony about DNA evidence and what orifices it was recovered from—then no one else in this courtroom can dare turn away.

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"The balance is delicate. It requires a willingness to cooperate, but not to be trampled on; pride in one's fellow Muslims, yet recognition that threats may lurk among them.",9,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"""It's like walking a tightrope,"" said Mr. Shata, 37, speaking through an Arabic translator. ""You have to give Muslims the feeling that the police are not monsters. And you have to give the police the feeling that Muslims are respectful and clean.""",10,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Months spent with Mr. Shata, both around the city and in his mosque, the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, revealed the vastly complex calling of imams in the United States.",11,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"In the Islamic world, imams are defined as prayer leaders. But here, they become community leaders, essential intermediaries between their immigrant flocks and a new, Western land. When Islamic traditions clash with American culture, it is imams who step forward with improvised answers. Outside the mosque, many assume the public roles of other clergy, becoming diplomats for their faith.",12,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"But in the years since Sept. 11, diplomacy has given way to defensiveness. For American imams, no subject is more charged than terrorism. While under scrutiny themselves, imams are often called upon to usher the authorities past the barriers of fear that surround their communities. Many are reluctant. They worry that their assistance will backfire in unwarranted investigations, or a loss of credibility at the pulpit.",13,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"At Mr. Shata's mosque, people can recite a list of dubious cases as easily as popular verses of the Koran: The three Moroccan men in Detroit who were falsely accused of operating a terrorist sleeper cell; the Muslim lawyer Brandon Mayfield, who was mistakenly linked to bombings in Madrid; the two teenage girls from New York City who were held for weeks but never charged after the F.B.I. identified them as potential suicide bombers.",14,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"At the same time, imams must contend with their own mixed reputation, which is marked by a few high-profile cases, like that of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of plotting to blow up New York landmarks.",15,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,Imams like Mr. Shata -- men who embrace American freedom and condemn the radicals they feel have tainted their faith -- rarely make the news.,16,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"The authorities are well acquainted with Mr. Shata, and speak highly of him. The officers of Mr. Shata's local police precinct often turn to him for help when Muslims in Bay Ridge refuse to be questioned. The senior F.B.I. counterterrorism official in New York, Charles E. Frahm, described his interaction with Mr. Shata as ""very positive.""",17,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,Mr. Frahm was in the room last August when Mr. Mershon challenged the imam.

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Yet for Mr. Shata, cooperation brings conflicting emotions. He can charm a class of rookies at the 68th Precinct in Brooklyn, turning a perfunctory cultural sensitivity seminar into a comedy hour. But he is quietly outraged that an unmarked car shadows a respected Palestinian board member of his mosque.",20,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"The imam is saddened to see so many Muslims leave America, pushed out by new immigration policies, intimidation or despair. He also fears for those who have remained: for the teenage boy in his mosque who is suddenly praying at dawn, having drifted from a high school that left him alienated.",21,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Still, Mr. Shata said, the anger and fear, no matter how deeply felt, are tempered by something greater: the devastating impact of Sept. 11 on non-Muslim Americans.",22,2007,Features

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,The competing demands on Mr. Shata became plain when he arrived in Bay Ridge about a year after Sept. 11.,24,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Crisis gripped the city's Muslim neighborhoods. Law enforcement agents searched businesses and homes, and held hundreds of men for questioning. Women were harassed in the subway.

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Mr. Shata's predecessor, Mohamed Moussa, was drained. ""I needed a change or I would destroy myself,"" said Mr. Moussa, who now works as one of three imams at a well-funded mosque in Union City, N.J.",26,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Like many mosques in struggling immigrant neighborhoods, the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge had little choice but to search abroad for a replacement. America produces few imams with the qualities sought by foreign-born Muslims: fluency in Arabic, and a superior command of the Koran and the laws that codify Islamic life.",27,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Mr. Shata was an enticing candidate. Like Mr. Moussa, he had trained at Al Azhar University in Cairo, a citadel of Islamic scholarship. Through an Azhar professor, Mr. Moussa found Mr. Shata in Germany, where he had been working as an imam.",28,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,The men who sit on the mosque's board were pleased to find charisma in their new imam. The white brick mosque on Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge survives largely on the donations of its congregants. Only a riveting speaker can draw them.,29,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"But soon after Mr. Shata arrived, he became aware of another, less visible audience. In mosques around the city, informers were hidden among the praying masses, listening for what officials call ""double talk"" -- one voice of extremism inside the mosque, and another of tolerance outside.",30,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"The attention did not worry Mr. Shata, he said, because he had nothing to hide. ""My page is clean,"" he said.",31,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"But when the authorities came seeking his help, he faced a choice. He could welcome them and improve the mosque's public standing, or he could rebuff their inquiries at the risk of seeming obstructionist.",32,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"""There's a wall of silence around these mosques,"" said Representative Peter T.

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Shahawar Matin Siraj, 23, was a chatty Pakistani immigrant who worked in the Islamic bookstore next to the mosque. On the job, he was sometimes seen talking to James Elshafay, 21, a soft-spoken Muslim American from Staten Island.

He tried to interest the imam in a real estate deal, proposing that Mr. Shata use his influence over Muslims to collect money owed to Mr. Daoudi in exchange for a secret cash commission, Mr. Shata recalled.",41,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"The imam wanted nothing to do with the scheme, he said, and kept his distance. He found Mr. Daoudi off-putting. He claimed to be the son of a famous Egyptian sheik and was known at the mosque for weeping when he prayed. But he also smoked.",42,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"""Piety in Islam forbids smoking,"" Mr. Shata observed.",43,2007,Features
Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"Most striking was the anti-American sentiment that Mr. Daoudi espoused, Mr. Shata said.

Andrea Elliott,2006-03-06,To lead the faithful in a faith under fire,"This perception irks Mr. Frahm, the F.B.I. official. Informers' reports are closely vetted, he said, and their motives are irrelevant if they provide correct information.",52,2007,Features

Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"The survivors would henceforth be haunted by the oldest, most vexing question of all: whether there is a destiny that shapes our fates or whether it is simply a matter of chance, of luck, of the way the wind blows.",6,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"It was a busy day for Pietrycha and his colleagues. The classic ingredients for a tornado--warm air to the south, cooler air north and a hint of wind shear--had seemed imminent most of the morning. Spring and early summer are boom times for tornadoes, the most violent storms on Earth.",7,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"What bothered Pietrycha was a warm front that loitered ominously across southern Illinois. If the front's moist, humid air moved north too quickly in the daylight hours, clashing with cooler air, the instability could create thunderstorms liable to split off into tornadoes.",8,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"But by early afternoon, it seemed that maybe, just maybe, northern Illinois would escape. If the front waited until after sunset to arrive, its impact would be negligible because the air near the ground--with no sunshine to warm it--would cool off. Nope, a relieved Pietrycha said to himself. Probably not today.",9,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"It was only a hunch. Meteorologists know a lot about tornadoes, but with all they know, they still can't say why some thunderstorms generate tornadoes and some don't. Or why tornadoes, once unleashed, do what they do and go where they go.",10,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"That's why forecasting is as much art as science. Too many warnings not followed by actual tornadoes make people skeptical and careless. Too many warnings can be as dangerous as too few. And while meteorologists can spot an approaching hurricane days in advance, the average warning time for a tornado is 11 minutes.",11,2005,Features

Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"Flip the switch. A moment later they were joined in the firehouse by Steve Maltas' mother, Gloria, who'd hustled there when she heard about the storm. She, too, worked at the firehouse in her spare time.",97,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"But even with the siren, the townspeople weren't paying attention. When Gloria Maltas looked outside, she saw them standing in the street, watching the sky. Maybe they thought the siren was just a precaution, or maybe they were trusting old Utican wisdom: A tornado won't go in a valley. A tornado won't cross water. Both were false.",98,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"So Gloria, ordinarily a shy, reticent woman who deeply disliked anything that could be remotely construed as making a spectacle of herself, who usually spoke in a soft, whispery voice that made listeners lean in a little to catch her words, did something wholly uncharacteristic: She directed Steve to one side of Mill Street and she took the other, and they began running and yelling at people who stood in the doorways, telling them to get inside, take cover, for God's sake go back in.",99,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"Gloria kept running. She ran faster than she'd ever run before, and she didn't realize how fast she was running. A day or so later, her legs ached and she couldn't figure out why, and then she remembered the running, running up and down Mill Street, screaming at people who must've wondered what on earth had gotten into sweet little Gloria Maltas.",100,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"Steve Maltas made it back to the fire station, where his last warning was issued to a few folks who stood in the doorway of the bar across the street. ""Get in! Get back in!"" he hollered, and he saw that one of them was Jay Vezain, who did as he was told, and then the others who'd been standing behind Vezain went back in too.",101,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"Because the fire station didn't have a basement, Maltas and Burrows and the other firefighters who had gathered there headed for the boiler room. They heaved the door shut behind them, and then they waited, having done all they could do, for whatever the next flurry of seconds would bring.",102,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"Gloria Maltas, whose last warning was to the people standing outside Duffy's, wasn't going to make it back to the fire station. It was only a block away, and she had started back, thinking she could do it, but then she glanced over her shoulder and Oh my God saw the tornado gaining on her, spreading out behind her.",103,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"She was running toward the station, running and running, but there wasn't time, there wasn't time. The big black triangle was rising right behind her, capturing more and more of the sky.",104,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"At Mill Street Market, the tiny grocery store in the middle of the block, Gloria halted at the glass door--the one with the ""We appreciate our customers"" sign--and pounded on it. Closed, locked. Nobody stirred inside. Gloria had done her job too well. They were all in the back, she guessed, having fled into the big walk-in freezer.",105,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"Still Gloria pounded and hollered, because there was nothing else to do, no other option. She had to get inside somewhere, anywhere, and then she saw Rona Burrows running toward the door, jiggling the key in the lock, twisting it, that lock was always stubborn.",106,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"""Hurry up!"" cried Burrows, pulling her inside. ""If I have to see you flying through the air, I'll kill you!"" she added, half-laughing, half-sobbing, and then they got to the back of the store, past the meat display case and into the freezer where the others--Mary Jo and Bruce Conner, the couple who managed the market, and a woman Gloria didn't know--were huddled.",107,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-05,A Wicked Wind Takes Aim,"They waited that final minute, not knowing if they were really safe, not knowing if the walls would hold, not knowing if these were the last seconds of their lives, and they embraced, and then--at 6:09 p.m.--there was a sound like hundreds of cars being dumped on the roof, and they knew that it was, unmistakably, upon them.",108,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"In the basement of Duffy's Tavern, dirt sifted between the floorboards overhead for 10 seconds. They could hear muffled booms from above, the crashes, the bangs and cracks and rattles. The whole building seemed to shudder, as if bumped rudely in a crowd. Sixty seconds before, they had hurried into the basement, chased there by a tornado flying toward the tiny town of Utica at 6:09 p.m. on April 20.",1,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Down the wooden steps they had come, hurrying, hurrying, but trying not to shove. The lights died. Once at the bottom, they huddled shoulder to shoulder, next to things they couldn't see: shelves with plastic tubs of French dressing and twist-tied bags of the green and white mints that Lisle Elsbury liked to hand out to departing customers.",2,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Elsbury, the owner of Duffy's, was last in line, having gathered everybody--six staff members, six customers--and made sure they were headed down the stairs and then closing the basement door behind him.

Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Chris Rochelle, 23, the bartender, was right behind his boss. When he saw that Duffy's seemed intact, Rochelle moved straight out the back door to check on the rest of the town. He had good friends up and down this street, but none better than Larry Ventrice over at Milestone, Larry who'd encouraged him to start lifting weights again and take care of himself, Larry who'd lent him a car in which to drive home to Kansas last Christmas. If Duffy's looked OK, then Rochelle wanted to help his friend Larry clean up Milestone.",8,2005,Features

Milestone's gone!"" Even as he was saying it, even as the words flew out of his mouth, it didn't sound possible. But it was. He had seen it. Or, not seen it.",11,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Steve Maltas, who had taken refuge in the boiler room of the firehouse along with seven other volunteer firefighters, shoved open the heavy door. Yep, the building was still standing.",12,2005,Features

Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"A knee-high pile of rubble--sandstone blocks, thick wooden beams and a crusty overlay of broken concrete--seethed and steamed in the space where a two-story building had stood since 1887, right across the street from the firehouse.",14,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"For a few seconds Maltas and the others were too stunned to move, too numb, their minds utterly rejecting what their eyes were telling them was true: A building had been flattened in 10 seconds, like a sandcastle squashed by a bored kid at the beach.",15,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"They broke out of their astonishment and ran across the street to the jagged pile. Where to start? What to do? Good God. The center was absolute mashed chaos--wood and concrete and stone and wire and a thick powdery mist of pulverized mortar--but the edges, the edges looked bizarre: At the edges were huge intact sandstone blocks that had toppled in neat rows, like dominoes.",16,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"They started pulling at the rocks, doing what anybody would do: trying to get to whoever was inside, grabbing and lifting and clawing. They could hear screams and calls for help, and it was a healthy sound, God knows, because silence would have been worse.",17,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Seconds later, they were joined by other people, people who had emerged from downtown buildings and looked around to check the damage and then saw--Good Lord--Milestone, what was left of Milestone, and so they ran to the site and bent over or dropped to their knees and pulled, scratched, dug and heaved the stones, but there were so many stones and so many layers and it seemed hopeless. They couldn't let themselves think that, though, so they just kept digging and pulling at stones.",18,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"So intent were they, so focused, that at first they didn't notice the damage to the rest of Utica. They didn't really see the garage right next to Milestone, where the Fire Department parked its ambulances, wrecked so badly that later it would have to be torn down. They hardly noticed that Starved Rock Bait & Tackle, the century-old building across the alley from Milestone where Jim Collins had sold gas, cigarettes, soda pop and hunting licenses for almost two decades, was a ruined mess.",19,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"All anybody could think about was Milestone, Milestone, Milestone, because the tavern wasn't just mauled and pummeled, wasn't just grievously damaged. It was gone.",20,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"In the top layer of the rubble, two bodies were clearly, excruciatingly visible. And because Utica is a small town, because everybody knows everybody, they knew who they were: Jay Vezain and Carol Schultheis, two local folks who'd been having a drink in Milestone just before the storm.",21,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"By the time Joe Krizel got there about five minutes later, at least two dozen people were tugging at the rubble. Krizel worked at Uniman, a sand plant on a hill just north of Utica. From his vantage point up there, he had watched the tornado move in, watched it churn and whip its way northeast, then saw it pause over Utica--10 seconds, he thought, no more--almost as if it had an appointment there, as if it knew where it wanted to go, right down to the street address. Krizel couldn't tear his eyes away from it.",22,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Then the spinning black cloud moved on, heading up the hill where it broke apart, and Krizel suddenly felt released from whatever spell that awful thing had cast over him.",23,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Krizel, 49, had been a volunteer firefighter for more than two decades. He knew there'd be a lot of damage, so he slid into his pickup to head downtown. Trouble was, the road was blocked by debris--ripped-up trees with their shocked roots still dangling, thrown-down telephone poles, big chunks of roofs, swatches of curled-up sheet metal--and he couldn't get through. He hollered at Blayne Bimm--son of Shelba Bimm, one of Krizel's Fire Department colleagues--who also worked at Uniman, and Blayne hopped into an endloader and cleared the way for the pickup.",24,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Krizel took a look at the mess that had been Milestone. He knew what kind of job this was: technical rescue, which meant equipment and expertise, not just hard work and good intentions. Maltas already had alerted state officials and in the next few hours 52 fire departments would respond. The streets of Utica would be jammed with firetrucks. But right now, it was just Joe Krizel and the Utica firefighters, and they could hear people calling for help from under the rubble.",25,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Krizel dashed into the firehouse, flung open his locker and started yanking on boots and coveralls. He slapped on his hardhat with the light on it.",26,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Back across the street, firefighters had just pulled Rich Little from a corner of the rubble, and Little had pulled out Jim Ventrice. It was the easiest rescue they'd have; from here on out, it would be desperate and difficult work, but the two men who'd been standing next to a couple of freezers in the basement seemed to be fine. It was astonishing, really: Amid the destruction, with an entire two-story building compressed into an appallingly tiny space, two men had climbed out. They were dazed and groggy and dust-covered, but alive.",27,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"A woman ran up to Little and embraced him. It was Kristy Kaiser, 35, the girlfriend he was supposed to meet in Milestone that night. But she'd seen the tornado blooming in her rear-view mirror like an assailant who'd been hiding in the back seat, so she pulled her Dodge Ram to the curb, jumped out and ran into a grocery store, where she spent the anxious minutes in a walk-in freezer with strangers.",28,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Now she was here with Little, here amid the confusion and the shouting. It was so chaotic that Ventrice wandered over to a stack of stones and sat down, and minutes later said hello to a friend, and the friend remembers thinking, ""Why's he bothering me when we got a crisis here?""--not realizing until much later that Ventrice himself had just been pulled out of the building. It was that kind of scene: wild, surreal, drenched in panic and dread and a kind of crazed disbelief.",29,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"Gradually, though, the firefighters took control, moving the townspeople back and back and back, so Krizel could get to work. They were afraid to touch Vezain and Schultheis, afraid they might send the whole fragile mass crashing down on the survivors inside, so they draped the bodies in plastic, and tried to put out of their minds what they would never get out of their memories. They had a job to do, there were more people down there, living people. They could hear them crying and screaming. So there was no time for grief or reflection.",30,2005,Features
Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"By 6:20, 11 minutes after the tornado belted Utica, Shelba Bimm and Dave Edgcomb, Utica's fire chief, showed up. They'd been in a class in Oglesby to upgrade their EMT certifications. When the tornado sirens sounded, their instructor, as protocol required, marched the students into the basement. On the way down, somebody turned on a dispatch radio and everybody got the news: Utica.",31,2005,Features

Julia Keller,2004-12-06,Milestone's gone!',"They had to abandon their vehicles at the edge of town, because there was too much stuff clogging the streets: trees and rooftops and hunks of siding, plus toppled power lines that twitched and sizzled. They had to claw their way through branches and shattered glass, around broken pipes and crinkled windowless cars, and they took a crazy, makeshift route under and over and through. It was like moving across a war zone, Bimm thought, like advancing through a dangerous maze during combat.",33,2005,Features

Right as the boys emerged there was a moment of panic because they were drenched in something sticky and red--Is it blood?

When Pettway arrived, he threw his slaves among Gee's slaves and named them all Pettway. Today, nearly every Bender is connected to the merger of those two slave clans.

Many, like Redford Pharmacy, believe they have only two choices: Install more elaborate security measures, or move out. So the drugstore added a buzzer system to control entry to its front door after 3 p.m., installed a panic button wired to a burglar alarm, and imposed a rule that no one could work alone.",17,1999,Features

A few hours earlier, Jo and the girls had started out from their 300-acre dairy farm in Van Wert County, in the northwestern corner of Ohio. The night before, Jo had worked her usual midnight shift — she drove a forklift and worked the assembly line at Peyton’s Northern, a distribution center for health and beauty products on the other side of the Indiana state line — and had come home around dawn to their double-wide mobile home and grabbed a few hours of sleep while Michelle and Christe finished packing.

They had good reason to be excited. This was the first family trip of their lives, the first time they had managed to free themselves from the daily rigors of the farm and get away together.

They went past the Riverside Cemetery and its big, black wrought-iron gate and past the Tastee Twirl and past the grain elevator in the little town of Rockford, with its one and only stoplight, and through the even smaller towns of Mercer and Neptune until finally, almost 50 miles after they left the farm, they reached the broad ribbon of I-75.",27,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Despite the late start, they made good time that first day. Jo almost certainly did most of the driving – Michelle, who had got her license just a few months before, was intimidated by highways – and Jo was not known for her strict adherence to speed limits. “I want to get there,” Jo would tell her friends.

A great deal of investigation would eventually be devoted to the question of how little experience the Rogers women had with boats and water. For the girls, at least, the ride at Silver Springs was one of the few times – in Christe’s case, perhaps the very first time – they had ever set foot on a boat. Neither girl was a confident swimmer, especially in water over their heads, and their mother could not swim at all.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Picture crawling out from under the covers on a morning like that. Picture throwing something on, heading outside into the dark and the cold and trudging down the driveway, hands jammed in pockets, to put in another shift at the milking parlor. Located next to the barn, the milking parlor is not a parlor at all, but a concrete box of a room with one tiny window and a fluorescent light and a claustrophobic little rectangular pit cut into the center of the floor. For the next two or three hours, this pit will be your home. You will stand inside it so you can work the milking machines at eye-level with the udders. The cows will be above you, of course, clopping over from the barn to their stations on both sides of the pit, and while you work, hurrying from one end of the pit to the other, checking the flow of their milk into the milkers and dipping their teats in iodine and rubbing peppermint oil onto their skin, they will moo and complain and unceremoniously deposit manure onto the floor around you.",38,1998,Features

You want to hurry back up to the house and take a shower. But before you do, have a good long look at the landscape around you. Gaze out over the fields, acres of brown, brown and more brown, stretching in every direction like a giant, mud-soaked quilt, and at the scattered stands of black and naked trees, and up into the low-hanging bowl of gray that is the sky.",39,1998,Features

The girls loved the cows – they loved animals, period – and knew their personalities and quirks. They had names for them all. There was Sage, Michelle’s favorite, and Rosie and Betty and Grandpa and April and May and June; Hal, who usually stuck with calling them by number, was inspired one day to give one the moniker of Crazy.",46,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Still, the grind of the farm was overwhelming. On top of the milkings and feedings, Hal and the rest of the family had to contend with a mountain of other tasks. There was the breeding — they’d owned a bull for a while, but switched to artificial insemination when he started chasing Jo and the girls — and delivering the calves and cleaning the barn every day and cleaning the milking parlor every day and keeping the machinery and equipment in good repair. They had to plow the fields and plant the crops and harvest the crops; sometimes, during harvest, Hal would go for three days straight without sleeping.

She led a sheltered childhood. She’d dated Hal in high school and married him a few months after graduation, when she was pregnant with Michelle. Though their wedding was held inside a church, her parents were so embarrassed by the pregnancy that they did not allow Jo to wear a wedding gown or to invite her friends to the reception. For their honeymoon, she and Hal were granted a weekend in nearby Fort Wayne, where they stayed at a Hospitality Inn.",54,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Somehow Jo made the best of things. She had a ringing laugh. She loved country music, loved to dance, made a fantastic potato soup. She and Hal owned a motorcycle, a Honda Goldwing, and she liked to ride behind him, the wind in her face. She was independent and strong-willed and not afraid to stand up to Hal; she listened to him and respected his opinion, but if he said something stupid, she could silence him with a look. She used to make him take her out to dinner, just so they could get away from the farm and talk about something other than the corn and the cows. She liked to tease Hal and would make fun of his woeful attempts at singing. She wrote him cards, telling him she loved him. She was a tough woman — tougher than her slender frame would have led a stranger to believe — but underneath the toughness, friends saw an enduring glow, a persistently optimistic outlook that had survived all her struggles.

She had once been beautiful — you can see it in her high school senior photo — but by May of 1989 she carried with her an unmistakable air of depletion, a sense that her life had been far too hard for far too long. You could see it in the circles beneath her eyes, her gaunt cheeks, the tight line of her mouth. She was 36, but looked 10 years older.",57,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"And no wonder. It wasn’t just the demands of the farm or the job at Peyton’s Northern. It wasn’t just her migraines, either, or the stress of raising two teenagers, ferrying the girls to church and softball practice and cheerleading camp.",58,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was everything. She seemed to exist in a state of permanent exhaustion. She worked the midnight shift at Peyton’s — the night trick, some people called it — to supplement the income from the farm and to qualify her and the rest of the family for health insurance benefits. Early in the morning, she’d drive home from the job, and help finish with the first milking and the chores. She’d get the girls off to school, and then ride with Hal into Willshire for breakfast, and then go back home and catch whatever sleep she could before the girls came home from school and it was time for the mid-afternoon milking and for her to make dinner. In the evenings, she would try to nap again before leaving for the next midnight shift. But it was never enough. She would fall asleep while driving.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The woman had once dated John, but now they were just sharing space. She told police that one evening she had come back to the trailer and been attacked by a man in a mask who handcuffed and blindfolded her and threatened her with a knife.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Caught in the middle of it all was Michelle. Now that John was off the farm, she wished the whole thing would just go away.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Most people, seeing Michelle for the first time, would have said she was pretty. Many would have described her as beautiful. She had wavy brown hair that fell just past her shoulders, a cautious smile, dark eyes that were somehow both playful and haunting. Like so many teenage girls, she was a shape-shifter. Sometimes, when she hadn’t put on all her makeup, she could pass for a middle school student; at other moments, when she was dressed up or when she tilted her head a certain way, she looked like a woman in her early 20s. Yet in both incarnations, there was something removed about her, a sense that an essential piece was kept in another room somewhere, under glass. The events of the past two years were in that wariness; they were there, too, in the lines already forming around her eyes.",78,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"At Crestview High, where she had just finished her junior year, Michelle was an average student known for being both a little shy and a little wild. She could be withdrawn around people she did not know, but could also drop into a boy’s lap and flirt outrageously. She smoked occasionally. At parties, when others were drinking beer, she preferred wine coolers. On the way to school, she sat at the back of the bus with the guys from the agricultural club and listened to their off-color jokes and laughed when they grabbed for her rear.",79,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The brazen exterior left Michelle with a bit of a reputation. In keeping with the age-old traditions of high school, other students spread whispered stories about her. Michelle knew she was a fixture of school gossip — she talked about it with her girlfriends — but she did not particularly care. Or at least she pretended not to care. The truth was, beneath the surface, there was a bruised sweetness to Michelle, a painful vulnerability more complex than either her reputation or the facade she presented to others.",80,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Publicly she may have shrugged off the gossip. But privately she scribbled notes to friends, saying she was lonely. Sometimes, she talked about going to college and becoming a veterinarian, swearing she would never allow herself to wind up on a farm, staring at cows for the rest of her life. Other days, she said she wanted to get married and raise a family on a farm. She had a schoolgirl’s fascination with rings, wearing four of them — two gold and two silver — on her left hand, one on each finger. Her bedroom was decorated with pictures of unicorns. She belonged to the 4-H Club and to the Future Farmers of America. She chewed Bazooka bubble gum. She listened to Guns N’Roses, U2, Madonna. On weekend nights, she liked to cruise up and down Main Street in Van Wert. If she was going to a school dance, she made a point of stopping by her maternal grandparents’ house first so they could see her dress. She sometimes wore wide, pink-rimmed glasses, not to correct her eyesight but because she thought them stylish.

Neither had a date that night, and so they’d been free to pursue each other; they’d talked until the sun came up, by which point they were a couple. Although they’d dated only a few weeks, Michelle was already growing close to Jeff and had accepted his class ring as proof that they were going steady. The ring was adorned with a stone of cubic zirconium and a carving of a knight atop a horse — in honor of the Crestview High Knights — and Michelle was terrified of losing it while working in the barn. Instead of wearing it on one of her available fingers, she kept the ring in her purse.",83,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,The two of them were a good couple. They’d known each other since seventh grade and thought of each other first as friends. Between them there was true affection and respect. Jeff had heard the talk over the past year or so about something bad happening with Michelle and her uncle. But Jeff sensed that she did not want to talk about it and left the subject alone.,84,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Didn’t think it was any of my business,” he says.",85,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The night before Michelle and her sister and mother began their trip, Jeff came out to the house. The two of them stood in the laundry room and kissed goodbye. Michelle got emotional, saying how much she’d miss him. To others, a week’s vacation to Florida would have been nothing extraordinary. To Michelle, it must have seemed like she was headed for the far side of the moon. She was excited about the trip and could not wait to get started. But that night, in her boyfriend’s arms, Michelle’s eyes filled with tears.",86,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Christe Rogers did not have a boyfriend.,87,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Only 14, she was officially not allowed to date for two more years. It was the story of her life: Christe had always been and would forever remain the little sister.",88,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"She was so much younger than Michelle, younger in ways that could not be chalked up solely to the three-year difference in their ages. There was an openness to her that had been squeezed out of Michelle. Christe was more outgoing, more carefree. Though the family’s ordeals had clearly affected her, she seemed to have emerged relatively intact. On the outside at least, she continued to present herself as the beaming cheerleader.",89,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"At the time of the Florida trip, Christe had just finished eighth grade at Crestview Junior High. Her school was on the same campus as the high school, which meant that she and her sister rode the same bus. While Michelle sat with the guys, Christe stayed toward the front with the other cheerleaders. She did not tolerate rude comments directed her way, did not allow boys to touch her suggestively. Morning after morning, she made it clear that she was not her older sister, that she had a different set of expectations for how her life was to unfold. Somewhere along the way she had been designated, or had designated herself, as the good girl of the Rogers family.",90,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Christe fulfilled every requirement of the part. She rode a motorscooter, liked to roller skate, played catcher for her softball team, owned an unbelievable number of teddy bears. The word used most often to describe her was “bubbly.” She wore three friendship bracelets, braided and woven and marked with pink, green and white stripes, on her left wrist. She was sensitive about her height — she was 5-foot-1, at best — and deployed untold quantities of gel and spray in the task of making her bangs rise straight up in an astonishing 4-inch plume, just so she would appear taller. On the softball diamond, playing catch behind home plate, she was so fearless that the umpire had to continually tell her to back away from the batter.",91,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“A little ball of fire,” remembers Jeff Feasby.",92,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"She had a round birthmark, about the size of a silver dollar, at the top of her right leg. She played the saxophone. She chewed her fingernails. Early every morning, when it was time for the first shift with the cows, she was the last one to wake up.",93,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Chris, you couldn’t have got her out of bed with a damn stick of dynamite,” says Hal.",94,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"She had always been especially close to her father. Before she was old enough to go to school, she used to follow Hal everywhere. When he was out plowing, she’d plop down under a nearby tree with a coloring book and some crayons. When he was working the combine, she’d ride with him in the cab, sitting on the heater, singing her little songs for him. Even after she grew older, the two of them remained best friends. Hal called both daughters his ”princesses,” but Michelle was shy, like he was, and Christe was warm and friendly and had such an easy charm that their dad was drawn to her. He loved and respected Michelle, but he felt a special bond with Christe and made little effort to hide it.",95,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“There ain’t nothing about it,” says Hal. “That’s just my little girl.”",96,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As with so many siblings, Christe waged an ongoing rivalry with Michelle, the two of them arguing over the chores and what to watch on TV and who had borrowed whose outfit last and not returned it. For her part, Michelle could not help feeling jealous of all the attention showered on Christe. It was hard enough that she was more popular at school; even more painful was the way she so clearly won out in the affections of their father. Michelle was not blind. She saw the signs, felt the sting.",97,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Through it all, though, she remained protective of Christe.",98,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"This is the single most telling fact about Michelle Lee Rogers of Van Wert County, Ohio, the quiet girl who had just completed the 11th grade and would never make it to the 12th, who had chosen a seat at the back of the bus and would never find her way up front, who longed for an acceptance that would never be hers. This is the proof that, despite all she had endured and was yet to endure, the light within her had not yet been snuffed out:",99,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"During the worst of those years on the farm, before the allegations about her uncle surfaced and before anyone understood what she was going through, Michelle somehow had the strength and the presence of mind to guard Christe. She checked on her, paid attention to her whereabouts, tried not to leave her alone with John. Repeatedly she fought to make sure that Christe stayed safe.",100,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Think of Michelle, then, and remember. When she was trapped and frightened and most alone, she kept watch over her little sister.",101,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Due back in Ohio at the end of the week, they were determined to see everything, do everything, set foot inside the gates of as many theme parks as humanly possible.",103,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That Sunday night, after they left Silver Springs, Jo and the girls drove to Titusville, near Cape Canaveral, and stayed at a Quality Inn. The next day, Jo wrote a postcard to Hal, telling him how the girls were dragging her everywhere. Michelle, meanwhile, wrote a postcard to Jeff Feasby. Jeff’s birthday was coming up in a couple of days, and Michelle wanted to send him something. She chose a card adorned with one of the Sunshine State’s most popular icons: the immortal, tacky image of a young woman in a bikini, on all fours in the sand, laughing provocatively despite the fact that a big bull gator is standing right behind her, its jaws open wide. FUN TIMES IN FLORIDA, it said beneath the photo.",104,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"On the back of the card, Michelle wrote:",105,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Hi! How is everything with you? I’m doing great. Yesterday we went to the Zoo in Jacksonville. I was visiting my relatives and we found Geoffrey (you). Later we went to Silver Springs and rode on a glass bottom boat. Today we are going to a beach and then to Sea World. You have fun at work and behave yourself. Have a great birthday. I’ll be thinking of you! I miss you!

Love ya,

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was Monday, May 29. The pace of the trip, already relentless, was about to kick into overdrive. The Rogers women were in the heart of vacationland now, poised to begin their run through the massive tourist attractions sprawled across the middle of the state. They began that day, as Michelle had said they would, with a trip to Sea World. Then the next day they went to Epcot, and then the day after that they went to Disney’s MGM Studios. Then they returned to their hotel, a Gateway Inn, and presumably collapsed.",107,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The next day was Thursday, June 1. They left the Gateway Inn that morning shortly after 10 a.m. and turned the Calais back onto I-4 and headed for Tampa, where they were thinking of seeing Busch Gardens and perhaps lying on the gulf beaches.",108,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They reached their hotel, the Days Inn at Rocky Point, just before 12:30 p.m. They checked in, picked up a brochure on Busch Gardens and went to their room, which was on the second floor, facing the shoreline of Tampa Bay. Room 251 was generic, cheerfully anonymous, drenched in teal: dark teal carpet, chairs with teal cushions, curtains made from a floral pattern set in teal, two double beds covered with teal quilts of a similar pattern.",109,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Shortly after they went up to the room — phone records put the time at 12:37 p.m. — Michelle placed a long-distance call to Jeff Feasby at the Union 76 station where he worked in Van Wert. It was Jeff’s birthday, and Michelle had arranged to have flowers and balloons sent to the gas station that morning.",110,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Did you get the flowers?” she asked, laughing because she knew it would embarrass him to receive such a romantic gift at work, in front of the other guys.",111,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Yeah,” said Jeff, who was indeed embarrassed. The flowers were on display atop the station’s cigarette machine, but he was already planning to move them into the back room to get them out of sight.",112,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Michelle and her boyfriend talked for close to 10 minutes that day. Questioned later about the conversation, Jeff would say he did not remember many of the exact words that passed between them — he was busy working the register when the phone rang — but he believes Michelle told him that the vacation was going well and they were having fun. He could hear Michelle’s mother, saying hi to him in the background, and Jeff said hi back, and Michelle talked about how she and Christe wanted to go to the beach but their mom wouldn’t let them near deep water. Then she said goodbye.",113,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"A few minutes later, at 12:57, another call was placed from the room phone, this time to the information line at Busch Gardens. It appears unlikely that the Rogers women actually made it to the theme park that day; the rolls of film recovered with their belongings contained no snapshots from Busch Gardens, and no receipts or souvenirs from Busch Gardens were found either. How the Rogers women spent that afternoon after checking into the motel remains a mystery.",114,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"There is a picture of Michelle from that last day, though, sitting on the floor of the motel room. She is wearing a blue bikini top, white shorts and sandals; draped over her right arm is a peach-colored blouse that she is either putting on or taking off. On her left hand, her collection of rings shines in the light. Her hair appears to be slightly wet, as though she has just taken a shower or been swimming. Her throat and neck are red with sunburn. Her face is tilted upward, staring directly into the camera.",115,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"She is not smiling. She is not frowning. If anything, her expression is matter of fact, with a touch of impatience. Photographed while changing her clothes, she is obviously in transition. She has somewhere to go, something to do, and she is ready to get on with it.",116,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,They were seen that night at dinner.,117,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"A businessman from Houston, staying at the Days Inn for a conference, noticed them in the motel’s restaurant. The man arrived at the restaurant around 7. Eating his meal, he found himself watching the woman and two teenage girls at the booth beside his table. He did not mean to stare, he later explained, but they were directly in his line of sight; whenever he lifted his eyes from his food, he could not help but look their way.",118,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The man was close enough to hear the sound of their voices, but not their exact words. They were obviously in a good mood, though, laughing and joking. When they finished eating and got up from the booth, Michelle looked at him.",119,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Hi,” she said, and then she and her sister and mother walked out.",120,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That Thursday evening, they shot one more photo. It was the last snapshot on the last roll discovered in their room. Taken from the balcony outside 251, with the camera pointed toward the bay, it shows a cluster of palm trees silhouetted against a glowing evening sky.",121,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Sometime after they snapped the picture, the three of them left the Days Inn and got into the Calais and drove toward the horizon they had just glimpsed from the balcony. They had an appointment to keep. Jo had written the directions on a piece of paper, and now she and the girls were on their way.",122,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,They would not see the sun again.,123,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That weekend, Hal Rogers kept watching the driveway. He would walk out of the milking parlor, finished with another shift with the cows, and glance up toward the house, hoping to see the Calais.",124,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Hal didn’t understand it. He hadn’t heard from Jo or the girls for several days, but he was sure that Jo had told him they would be back on Saturday or Sunday at the latest. Jo was due back at work on Monday; Michelle’s summer school classes were starting.",125,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,He tried not to worry. He told himself everything was fine.,126,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,The first sighting was early that Sunday morning.,130,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"This was June 4, another hot and beautiful day. The Amber Waves, a sailboat on its way home to Tampa after a trip to Key West, had just crossed under the Skyway when several people on board saw an object in the water. It looks like a body, one of them said.",131,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was a female, floating face down, with her hands tied behind her back and her feet bound and a thin yellow rope around her neck. She was naked from the waist down.",132,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"A man from the Amber Waves radioed the Coast Guard, and a rescue boat was dispatched from the station at Bayboro Harbor in St. Petersburg. The Coast Guard crew quickly found the body, but recovering it from the water was difficult. The rope around the neck was attached to something heavy below the surface that could not be lifted. Noting the coordinates where the body had been found, the Coast Guard crew cut the line, placed the female in a body bag, pulled the bag onto the boat and headed back toward the station. The crew members had not yet reached the shore when they received another radio message: A second female body had just been sighted by two people on a sailboat.",133,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"This one was floating to the north of where the first body had been sighted. It was 2 miles off The Pier in St. Petersburg. Like the first, this body was face down, bound, with a rope around the neck and naked below the waist. The same Coast Guard crew was sent to recover it, and while the crew was doing so, a call came in of yet a third female, seen floating only a couple of hundred yards to the east.",134,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The three bodies were taken to the dock at the Coast Guard station to be examined and photographed by the police investigators already arriving at the scene. The bodies were bloated and had begun to decompose, but it was still possible to determine that they were white women who appeared to be fairly young.",135,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The hands and feet of all three were tied and bound in the same manner, though the left hand of the second woman was loose. Before dying, she had apparently wrested the hand free. All had duct tape over their mouths. The second and third bodies had concrete blocks attached to the ropes around their necks. Though the rope around the neck of the first body had been cut by the Coast Guard, it was assumed that a concrete block had been tied to that line as well.",136,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The discovery of a triple homicide on a quiet Sunday morning — a morning so perfect, it was difficult to conceive of anyone having even a violent thought — galvanized law enforcement agencies from all around Tampa Bay. Divers were soon plumbing the waters near the Skyway, looking for the object that had been cut from the line attached to the first body. Police boats crisscrossed the bay, making sure there were no more bodies to be found. A plane circled overhead, searching for the same.",137,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Back at the dock where the bodies had been brought, detectives were already trying to understand what had happened to the women. Given that all three were partially nude, sexual assault seemed likely. As for the cause of death, a quick examination of the bodies revealed no obvious bruises, knife wounds, or bullet holes. It was possible that the women had been bound and gagged, weighed down with the concrete blocks and then tossed alive into the water to drown at the bottom of the bay.",138,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Disturbing as that scenario was, there was no time to focus on it just yet or to determine its plausibility. To know even the most basic facts of how the women died, the detectives would have to wait for the results of the autopsies. And before they could search for the killer, they needed to first learn who the victims were. No identification had been found on the bodies, and there had been no local reports of three women missing.",139,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,What were their names? Where did they live? Were they locals or tourists?,140,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"All the detectives had to go on was the bodies themselves and the clothing and jewelry they had been wearing. One of the women, probably the oldest of the three, had long brown hair and had been found in a black T-shirt and with a gold wedding band on the ring finger of her left hand. Another had medium-length brown hair and was wearing a peach-colored shirt and three cloth bracelets, braided and decorated with pink, green and white stripes, on her left wrist.",141,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Finally there was the young woman who had apparently struggled hard enough to remove one of her hands from the rope. She had wavy brown hair and wore a black tank shirt over a blue bikini top. On her left hand, the hand that had broken free, she wore four rings. Two gold, two silver. One on each finger.",142,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Jeff Feasby was getting impatient. Michelle was supposed to be back by now, and he missed her. So he kept phoning the farm, asking Hal Rogers if he’d heard from them.",145,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Hal did not know what to say. As the days went by without a word, he was growing increasingly panicked. He called Jo’s friends and relatives to see if she’d contacted them, called Jo’s boss at the distribution center to make sure he’d understood correctly when she was due back on the job, checked with the Van Wert Sheriff’s Office and the Ohio Highway Patrol and reported them missing. No one had heard a thing.",146,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Then, one night early that week, Jeff Feasby phoned again. He’d gotten a postcard from Michelle. The one with the girl in the bikini and the bull gator and the words on the front that said FUN TIMES IN FLORIDA. Hal asked him to bring it to the house. Jeff drove right over, and Hal held the postcard, reading it over and over, searching in vain for some hint of what might have happened.",147,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Hal was pacing back and forth through the house, smoking one cigarette after the other. He was sure something had gone terribly wrong. Maybe they’d been robbed and left somewhere, he told himself. Or maybe their car had gone off the highway into a marsh or in some woods where no one would find them for weeks. Maybe they were still alive, trapped somewhere, hurt, waiting to be rescued.",148,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The images played through his mind until finally he could not stand it anymore. Desperate to take some kind of action, he went to the bank that Wednesday and withdrew some money. He had a plan. He was going to get into the air and conduct a search himself. He would find a private plane and a pilot and together they would fly over the roads Jo and the girls had traveled between Ohio and Florida.",149,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"For days, the room had been untouched. The guests, obviously one or more women, had checked in a week before and had made it up to the room, leaving their suitcases on the floor and a purse on the table and other items strewn about. From that day on, though, there had been no sign of their returning. The beds had not been slept in. The shower and bath had not been used. The personal items had not been disturbed.",152,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That was how the chain began to unfold. The maid’s suspicions were passed along to the Days Inn’s general manager, who called the Tampa police and informed them that one or more of the motel’s guests appeared to be missing.",154,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"By this point the newspapers and TV news shows had been filled for several days with reports about the three bodies found in the bay.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The Tampa officers sealed off Room 251 and radioed for their superiors. Soon detectives were arriving from both Tampa and St. Petersburg, and the room was being searched and photographed and dusted for prints, and all the personal belongings were being inspected and bagged and numbered.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Nothing in the case was to be easy. To begin with, it had not been clear which city’s police department should have jurisdiction over the murders. The bodies had been recovered in St. Petersburg waters, but Jo and her daughters had disappeared from a motel room in Tampa. So a special task force was formed, made up of more than two dozen investigators from both cities’ departments and from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Marine Patrol.",226,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"No suspicious fingerprints had been identified so far in Room 251 of the Days Inn at Rocky Point. Most of the prints in the room that had been checked belonged to the Rogers women or one of the maids. No unusual prints had yet been identified on the exterior or the interior surfaces of the family’s car, either. In fact, the Calais was remarkably clean; the technician who processed the vehicle for prints said the car looked like it had gone through a car wash. There was the Clearwater Beach brochure, however. Found inside the car along with other personal items, the back of the brochure showed a map of Tampa Bay. The map was marked with directions, written in a hand different from Jo Rogers’, that described how to get to the Days Inn.",229,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Obviously the Rogers women had met someone on the day they were killed, probably when they first reached Tampa, and this person had helped them find their way to the motel. But who this person was, or how the person met up with them, was unknown.",230,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Even the question of how the three women were killed could not be answered with precision. The autopsies showed that they had died of asphyxiation, but the medical examiner could not determine whether they had drowned or been strangled by the ropes around their necks. Because the bodies had been in the water for several days, it was no longer possible to tell if there had been any sexual assault. Still, the most likely scenario appeared to be that the women had been tied and gagged, raped and then dropped into the water, one by one.",231,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As for how many assailants had been involved, that was anybody’s guess. Some theorized that it would have likely taken at least two attackers to subdue three victims. Others pointed out that one person, pointing a gun at a mother and her daughters, would have had no trouble compelling one of the victims to gag and tie up the other two before she was restrained herself. However many assailants there were, the nature and scope of this crime made it seem unlikely that the killer or killers were novices. It also seemed probable that the killer had derived some sadistic pleasure from forcing each of the women to witness what was happening to the others.",232,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Using credit card records and receipts found in the motel room, the investigators reconstructed the itinerary of the Rogers women in Florida. They developed the rolls of film discovered in the motel room and examined the snapshots for clues. The Nikon One-Touch used to shoot the film, however, had not been found in either the motel room or the car. This suggested that the killer may have used the camera to take photos of the attack and then kept the film and the camera as souvenirs of the murders.",233,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Fanning out across Florida and northward into Georgia, investigators compiled lists of all the guests and employees at the motels where Jo, Michelle and Christe had stayed.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They spoke with tidal experts at the University of South Florida, who confirmed that, based on the flow of Tampa Bay waters and the locations where the bodies had been found, it would have been impossible for the bodies to have been dropped from land or from a bridge. In other words, there was growing evidence to support the theory that the three women had been invited to the boat ramp by someone who took them out in a boat and killed them.",240,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"This led investigators back to the directions Jo Rogers had scribbled down and left in the car, the ones that suggested she and her daughters had been meeting someone with a blue and white boat. The detectives combed the boat ramp, asking if anyone had seen a blue and white boat on the day the women disappeared. They took the lists of the guests who had stayed at the same motels as the Rogers women, then cross-checked them against the names of more than 700,000 boaters registered in Florida as well as the names of thousands of others from Ohio.",241,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Early on, one promising lead involved a Hillsborough County man who owned a blue and white boat and who had been seen offering a ride on the boat to a couple at the same ramp from where Jo and her daughters had disappeared.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Detectives went to the man’s home. The boat was parked in the driveway. On the ground behind the boat were two concrete blocks, one with a dark stain on top of it; inside the boat was some yellow rope and white rope, similar to what had been used to tie up the Rogers women. When the detectives knocked on the man’s door and questioned him and his wife, he told them that on the day of the murders he had been out in his boat with some friends. A few moments later, though, the man pulled one of the detectives aside, out of earshot of his wife.",246,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In those first weeks of the investigation, a pair of detectives — Ralph Pflieger, from the St. Petersburg police, and Henry Duran, from the Tampa police — traveled to Van Wert County twice. They were there to learn more about Jo and Michelle and Christe and to gather whatever insights they could into the women’s personalities, habits, state of mind. The most pressing question before them, however, was whether there was any link between the murders and the sexual assaults that Michelle had allegedly suffered at the hands of her uncle, John Rogers.",252,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Certainly the uncle had no shortage of possible motives to have sought revenge against Michelle and the rest of the family. Did he have the means to carry it out?,253,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“I wouldn’t be surprised if John could have something to do with it,” Hal Rogers told the detectives. “But to put it bluntly, I think it would be a very remote possibility.”",254,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"John Rogers was in prison when the murders occurred. Just before he was sentenced, though, he had visited the Tampa Bay area. His parents sometimes wintered in Manatee County, staying at a trailer park in Ellenton, just a few miles south of the Sunshine Skyway. Over the years, John had often joined them there. His last visit had been in early 1989, a few months before the murders, and he had stayed for several weeks.",255,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Obviously, Pflieger and Duran needed to consider the possibility that John had somehow arranged the deaths of Jo and the girls during that visit. But after interviewing John at the Ohio prison where he was serving his sentence, the detectives agreed with Hal’s assessment and decided that it would have been extremely difficult for John to have had anything to do with the Rogers murders.",256,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"To begin with, there was no evidence that he was even aware of the three women’s vacation plans, making it unlikely that he could have hired someone else to carry out the attack.",257,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The only visitor he had received in recent months had been his mother, who had come to see him in April, long before Jo and the girls had made all their preparations for the trip. He had received no packages at the prison in recent weeks, and phone records showed that the only long-distance call he had made had been after the murders, when he called his parents’ home on Father’s Day.",258,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Inmates housed with Rogers confirmed that John was a loner with few friends inside the prison and that he did not have the connections to arrange a triple homicide. After meeting with John themselves, Pflieger and Duran agreed that he seemed too isolated to have put together such a conspiracy.",259,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As they conducted their investigation, however, the detectives discovered that John Rogers was not the only member of the family whose behavior had raised questions. They learned something strange about Hal Rogers, something that had long troubled many people in Van Wert County.",260,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In the spring of the previous year, after John Rogers was arrested, Hal had arranged for his brother’s bail. Hal knew that John was accused of raping Michelle, and yet he had personally posted the $ 10,000 surety bond.",261,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"There was something else unusual. In early June, after Jo and the girls were killed but before their bodies had been identified, Hal had withdrawn $7,000 in cash from an account at Van Wert National Bank. Where had that money gone?",262,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Pflieger and Duran easily established Hal’s whereabouts on the day and night of the murders. As always, he had been on the farm, milking the cows until late that afternoon, and had been back at it before dawn the next morning. This was on a farm approximately an hour away from the nearest airport of any size, which was across the Indiana border in Fort Wayne. There had been no time for him to get down to Florida and commit the murders. And there was nothing to suggest a motive for an act as heinous as killing his entire family.",263,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Still, the cash withdrawal begged the question. Was it possible that, for reasons unknown, Hal had hired someone to commit the murders?",264,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The detectives spent much of their time in Ohio on the farm, interviewing Hal at length. He was clearly numb with grief and appeared to be moving through the days on automatic pilot. His eyes, as Pflieger would later describe it, had a “blank, hundred-mile stare.”",265,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Even so, Pflieger and Duran needed some answers. One of the first things they asked was why he had posted his brother’s bond.",266,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Others had asked the same question, and the reply that Hal repeatedly had given was odd and unsettling and completely consistent with his proud and stubborn personality. He had agreed to post the bail, he said, after John was accused of raping the woman who had shared his trailer. By the time Hal learned about the allegations involving Michelle, he said, he had already given his word. And once he gave his word, he was required to keep it, no matter how hard it was or how unusual it appeared to others.",267,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Speaking privately to Pflieger and Duran, Hal said more. He said he had wanted to be supportive of Michelle but had also wanted to keep the peace with his brother and his parents. He said that he believed Michelle but was aware that someone was lying – either his brother or his daughter – and that he wanted to wait to see if the truth became any clearer. Furthermore, he said he had agreed to fulfill his pledge to his brother and post the bond only after John agreed in return to sell his half of the farm and never come near the property or Michelle again.",268,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As for the $ 7,000 he had taken out of the bank, Hal explained that he had withdrawn it during the agonizing days when Jo and the girls were missing.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Steffey rushed to turn off the lights. She stepped back into the shadows and kept her eyes fixed on the man. He was still standing in the grass, gazing toward her house. For what seemed like a long time, the two of them stood there motionless. Finally the man turned and called out a name. A little, fuzzy, white dog answered the call, and then he and the dog walked away.",374,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"There were three of them in all, each a 4-inch black binder, and they sat in Glen Moore’s cluttered little office on the second floor of the St. Petersburg police station. The books were filled with reports and photos and notes on tips and leads that had been pursued and eliminated. Taken together, they contained the sum of all that had been learned so far in the Rogers investigation.",377,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore, transferred to homicide almost six months after the murders, was troubled by the lack of progress in the case. He didn’t like to see the notebooks stuck on a shelf, with no one looking inside them. He wanted updates. He wanted movement.",378,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“What’s happening?” he would ask Jim Kappel, the detective who had been lead investigator on the case since it began the previous summer. “What’s going on?”",379,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"There wasn’t much Kappel could say. He was an experienced and respected homicide investigator; several years before, the St. Petersburg Exchange Club had named him the department’s officer of the year for his work on another murder case. For months, Kappel had poured himself into the Rogers investigation, sometimes working 14-hour days for weeks straight. And he had made some invaluable contributions, establishing the probable connection between the murders and the Madeira Beach rape. But by the spring of 1990, the tips generated by the composite drawing from the rape had long since stopped. There were no new leads. The case was growing colder by the minute.",380,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“It just kind of died,” Kappel would later say.",381,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As far as Moore could tell, Kappel was a good detective. But with all the problems that came with the investigation — no crime scene, almost no physical evidence, the apparently random selection of the victims — Kappel and the rest of the investigators had always been fighting against the odds. As the months went by, Kappel’s superiors had clearly lost confidence that the murders could ever be solved.",382,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Our department had never run into a case like this before,” says Moore.",383,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Complicating the situation was the fact that the department’s two homicide squads were swamped with other murders. In the year that the Rogers women died, there were 45 other homicides in St. Petersburg — a record for the city. The strain was showing; there were too many killings and too few detectives. A disturbing number of cases were not being solved.",384,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Something had to give. Kappel was still officially assigned to the Rogers case, but for some time now he had also been assigned to other cases that took up most of his time. Unless new information was developed, the Rogers case was going nowhere.",385,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In retrospect, it’s easy to see how these very qualities in Moore — his inexperience, his willingness to ask questions that others might have thought pointless — served him so well in his new assignment. But there were other, less obvious qualities that made him particularly well-suited to the difficulties of this case.",389,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"For one thing, he was quietly, politely, unbelievably stubborn. For another, he carried himself with the peace of a man who knows that, no matter what, his soul is saved and on its way to heaven.",390,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore’s faith in God was as robust as the rest of him. He was a big man, imposing, with a thick neck, wide shoulders, hands that looked huge enough to crush boulders into pebbles. He looked just like what he was, a former high school football player and discus thrower who had grown up in Georgia, moved to Florida, joined the police academy, married his high school sweetheart, had three children and devoted himself to a lifetime in law enforcement. Around the department, he was known as “Boomer.”",391,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"This was a nickname bestowed upon Moore eons ago, when he was a rookie and the department put on a wrestling exhibition for charity. At the last minute, Glen was persuaded to climb into the ring, where he unceremoniously creamed a couple of opponents, including his sergeant at the time, who took the whole thing surprisingly well once he managed to peel himself off the floor. The sergeant dubbed him “Boom-Boom,” which had evolved into “Boomer” and stuck ever since.",392,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The cartoonish nickname was a smoke screen. It made it easy to underestimate Moore. Because underneath the hulking exterior was an attentive and complicated person. Moore did not fit any of the usual stereotypes of a cynical, world-weary detective. He rarely swore. He hardly ever drank. After 20 years of marriage, he was still crazy about his wife and spoke about her with unrestrained reverence. He was an involved father who cheered for his children at their school plays and football and baseball games. He loved to read and possessed a roving curiosity about everything from politics to sports to history to science. When he wasn’t talking shop, he would engage people in conversations about the nature of time and eternity, the origins of the universe, whether intelligent life truly existed in Washington, D.C.",393,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"What defined Glen Moore, more than anything else, was his belief in God. Raised in the Baptist faith, he had been saved at the age of 12. All these years later, he prayed every day and served as a deacon at his church. Though he tried to avoid forcing his views on others, especially at the station, he found it hard to understand why everyone did not believe in God. To him, there was an abundance of undeniable, irrefutable proof of God’s existence; God, he believed, was an artist without compare whose works were on display for anyone with eyes to see. It was there in the staggering diversity of creatures multiplying across the planet. It was there in the brilliance of the stars exploding in the sky.",394,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“Who am I to challenge the wonders of this universe?” he would say. ”It’s all around us . . . God’s creation is all around us.”,395,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore was deeply conservative. He saw the Bible as God’s word, meant to be interpreted literally. He thought the theory of evolution was ridiculous. He believed that the country was coming apart and the apocalypse was close at hand. He was not one of these doom-and-gloom types, always waving signs proclaiming that the end was near; he didn’t run his life that way and didn’t teach his children to do so, either. Still, he believed in God’s judgment and did his best to conduct himself accordingly.",396,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He was perfectly capable of getting along with people who did not share his views. He had no trouble surviving in the modern, politically correct working world of the 1990s. In many ways, he was a progressive-minded boss. He was not particularly focused on hierarchy, did not feel the need to wave his rank or his seniority over those he worked with. He was a good listener, and encouraged those who worked for him to speak their minds. Time and again, he insisted that his detectives pull themselves away from their cases and take time for their families.",397,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Like anyone else, Moore had his flaws. He could be impatient, bullheaded and overbearing; some people in the department saw him as arrogant.

That’s when other people would give him the speech.",399,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Once, in an almost legendary episode when he was still with vice and narcotics, he lost it with another officer who swiped one of his apples. At the time, Moore was preparing for a body-building competition and was suffering under a Draconian diet that allowed him almost no sweets, no fats, virtually no food at all. He was training at the gym one day, looking forward to eating an apple that awaited him as his reward — a Red Delicious apple, to be precise — when he realized that this officer, who worked out at the same gym, had taken the apple and eaten it. Suddenly Moore was lifting the poor guy off his feet and pushing him against the wall.",402,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"His faith transformed the way he approached everything. Guided by his belief in the Bible, he was motivated by a strict and unwavering sense of morality.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Some people might have been surprised to learn that a veteran police officer, having seen so much ambiguity and complexity, would view life in such simple, black and white terms. But these were his beliefs, and Moore made no apologies. His faith was exactly the rudder he needed to navigate his way through the grueling, emotionally draining work in homicide. As he and his detectives sorted through the growing pile of cases before them, Moore was witness to some of the best and much of the worst of human behavior. To him, their job was part of the ongoing war between good and evil.",408,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"And when he looked over at the black notebooks from the Rogers case, he was determined to do everything possible to solve the murders and bring the killer to justice. To Moore, it was obvious that he and the other investigators were searching for someone possessed by a darkness beyond understanding. Someone who thought of people as objects to be manipulated and tortured and thrown away. Someone who had no remorse, no guilt, no conscience.",409,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"If Moore and his detectives didn’t catch this person, who would?

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Late that spring, as the one-year anniversary of the murders approached, Moore went to one of his superiors, Maj. Cliff Fouts, and told him he wanted to do a review of the case. He wanted to gather a team of new investigators — people who would look with fresh eyes — and have them pore over the case books and talk to the original investigators and then see what shook loose.",412,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Okay, said the major.",413,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That June, Moore put together his team, using several detectives who were new to the case as well as an investigator from the state attorney’s office and a former St. Petersburg police detective who was now a special agent for the FBI, assigned to the bureau’s Tampa office. They took the notebooks off the shelf and read through them and then sat down in a room with Jim Kappel and Ralph Pflieger, another experienced detective who had worked extensively on the case, and started emptying their brains of everything they had learned and everything they wondered and everything they considered.",414,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and his team had a list of items they wanted to go over with Kappel and Pflieger. It was a long and tough and sobering list, with close to 150 questions in all, and it took several days to go through. The process was not fun. Attempts were made to reassure Kappel and Pflieger, to remind them their efforts had been appreciated, to tell them they were not being criticized or attacked.",415,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"These efforts were not entirely successful. No one likes to be second-guessed, especially by a group of inquisitive, intelligent people who are trained in finding holes and who are all now playing devil’s advocate as they comb through every step you’ve taken for the past year. Moore and others who took part in the review all agree that Kappel and Pflieger grew frustrated during the questioning, that they felt as though they were being subjected to a marathon grilling.",416,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"For their part, Kappel and Pflieger say today that they understood the reason for the review and tried not to take it personally. Still, they had given the investigation everything they had.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Looking back on the review, the two investigators acknowledge that the sessions were sometimes difficult and even exasperating. Kappel remembers some verbal sparring. Pflieger says it felt as though the quality of his work was being questioned.",418,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and the other members of the team did not agree. Two weeks after the review began, Moore’s team concluded that many things had not been done. They discovered, says Moore, that the Clearwater Beach brochure recovered from the Rogers car — the one marked with the handwritten directions showing the family how to reach the motel — had never been processed for prints. Other items found in the car and in the motel room, Moore reports, had never been processed, either. Many of the hundreds of tips that had come pouring in at various points during the investigation had not been pursued.",421,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Moore had little interest in casting blame or pointing fingers for any oversights. He knew that Kappel and Pflieger and all the other investigators had done their best under extremely difficult circumstances.,422,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"But somewhere along the line, Moore believed, too many people had bought into the argument that this case could not be solved. As far as he was concerned, the most devastating error had not come in the handling of evidence or in how many calls were or were not made. It had been in the minds of the investigators and their superiors. The reason they had not gotten anywhere, he thought, was because they had decided there was nowhere to possibly go.",423,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore, too stubborn to know better, saw things differently. And now, after typing a 10-page memo detailing the findings of the review, he had the proof to show his commanding officers that there was a great deal of work to be done. He did not have to be particularly blunt about it, either. The bottom line was so obvious:",424,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Among these photos, they also hung pictures from Ohio, from when the three women were alive. There was one of Jo folding clothes, a school portrait of Michelle and a shot of Christe with her pouffed-up bangs. After a while, the evidence photos were taken down from the bulletin board to be replaced by other photos and maps and reports. But the family pictures stayed up, spurring the team onward.",439,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Not that the new team needed to be pushed. The two detectives that Moore had requested — Cindy Cummings and J.J. Geoghegan — were both highly motivated self-starters, full of energy and ideas.",440,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Working with Moore, the two of them began to fill in the gaps left open during the first year of investigation. Jim Kappel worked with them for a while, but soon he and Moore agreed it was best he move on. Kappel, ready for a change, transferred to another division and became a school resource officer.",441,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore, Cummings and Geoghegan went back to the beginning and took it step by step. They re-interviewed guests who had been staying at the Days Inn when the Rogers women disappeared.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"What they did not do that summer was pursue the information that Jo Ann Steffey had passed along to the Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputy in her accounting class.

For whatever reason, the tip did not reach Moore and his team.",445,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The truth was, they were already overloaded with everything before them. It wasn’t just the tips that had never been checked out. It was keeping track of all the tips that had been pursued, and keeping track of all the information from those tips, and keeping track of all the facts from all the interviews and statements and reports in the case. They were flooded with information.",446,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Which is why that fall, the police department sent Moore to England. The British police had a computer system called HOLMES — the acronym was far more enticing than the full name, Home Office Large Major Enquiry System — that had been used, two years before, in the bombing of the Pan Am 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland. HOLMES was designed to help investigators organize huge amounts of information. Though it had never been used in the United States, it was perfect for the Rogers case; even better, the company that owned it — McDonnell Douglas — was eager to share it with the St. Petersburg police, so other law enforcement agencies would be encouraged to buy it. The company was willing to donate the system and to help pay for the training required to use it.",447,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore spent a week in England, studying HOLMES and how it was being used at Scotland Yard. When he returned to St. Petersburg, he was convinced that the system was just what the team working the Rogers case needed. So he asked Larry Heim, another detective with expertise in computers, to join the investigation and serve as the HOLMES administrator, overseeing the use of the new system. Heim was eager to help in any way he could; when he looked at the photos of the two Rogers girls on the bulletin board, he saw his own two children staring back at him.",448,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In the weeks that followed, Heim and the other detectives and the office assistants working with the investigation took classes on how to put the system to work.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"HOLMES had arrived just in time. The river of information was about to overflow its banks. Moore and his team were due in several weeks to visit the FBI’s behavioral science unit at the bureau’s academy in Quantico, Va. This is the unit, popularized in novels and movies such as The Silence of the Lambs, that specializes in developing psychological profiles of killers in unsolved cases. Moore and the team would share everything they had learned about the case, and the FBI profilers would offer advice on what kind of person they were looking for.",450,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They also wanted to talk to as many people as possible who had known Jo and Michelle and Christe. Both for their purposes and the FBI’s, they needed to understand the trio’s emotional state at the time of the vacation. Would the awful experiences of the past several years — the allegations Michelle had made against her uncle John, the bitter split in the family over who was telling the truth — have left Jo and the girls more suspicious of people and therefore more reluctant to get on a boat with a stranger? Or would those experiences have made them more likely to trust a fresh, new face? The more they understood about the Rogers women, the easier it might be to figure exactly how they had died and who had killed them.",454,1998,Features

They wanted to show up unannounced, so he would have no chance to prepare and so they could see the unrehearsed reaction on his face when they arrived. To maximize the possibility of surprise, they decided to fly up on Sunday, Jan. 27, because that was the day the New York Giants were playing the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV at Tampa Stadium. If Hal had anything to do with the murders, and was worried about detectives coming up from Florida, they figured that Super Bowl Sunday – when half the law enforcement officers in Tampa Bay would be working some sort of detail or watching the game – would be a day when he would almost certainly not expect any visitors carrying badges.",458,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They interviewed him there in the house. As they asked their questions, they saw, all around them, signs that this was a man paralyzed with grief and denial. Michelle’s and Christe’s bedrooms were clean and tidy, exactly as they had left them before the trip to Florida; it was as though the girls were going to walk back in at any moment. Eighteen months had passed, but Hal had not been able to bring himself to put away their belongings. The rest of the place was a wreck. Clothes were scattered everywhere, the bathroom was beyond redemption, the litter box for the cats did not appear to have been emptied for weeks.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He talked about how much he missed Jo and the girls, especially Christe. His little girl, he called her. He said he appreciated all their efforts to catch the killer, but wasn’t sure that knowing who had done this would help him. It was hard enough that they were gone, he said.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Several hours later, when the investigators left the farm, they had learned nothing that would cast suspicion on Hal. To begin with, he didn’t appear to have had the opportunity or motive to arrange the murders. Although his wife and daughters had been covered by life insurance policies, the money Hal had received – Cummings recalls that it was just under $ 70,000, but Hal believes it was closer to $ 100,000 – was hardly enough incentive to kill one’s entire family. After their years in law enforcement, the detectives thought they knew enough to tell when someone was lying or putting on a show. Geoghegan said he would have bet a month’s salary that Hal was clean.",468,1998,Features

Now, after the visit by the investigators from Florida, the gossip took on new life. People were talking about all the time the detectives had spent in Ohio and all the questions they’d asked about Hal and his family.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The Tribune printed the reporter’s article late that April on the front page. The story was long, brimming with detail and driven by an unmistakable point of view. It said that the police investigation had shifted back to Ohio and the Rogers family. It described Hal as “a hot-tempered, distant man who hid his eyes behind dark glasses.” It talked about how Hal had posted his brother John’s bond in the rape case and about the questions raised by the bond. It talked about how Hal had failed to put headstones on his family’s graves. Over and over, it quoted people who described Hal as cold, bizarre, distant.",483,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"According to the FBI profile, the murderer was probably a serial killer. The profile predicted that the killer would turn out to be a white man, possibly between age 30 and 40, of above average intelligence. He was probably neat and meticulous, with strong social skills, affluent enough to own a boat, well hidden behind a persona of respectability. Given the relative difficulties of controlling three victims, the profile said the killer may have been helped by someone else. But if so, the killer would have psychologically dominated this other person.",489,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The profile laid out a chilling description of how the murders had most likely taken place. It said the killer enjoyed the suffering of others and fantasized about such an attack for a long time before carrying it out. He planned the murders carefully, then chose the Rogers women as his specific targets after meeting them in Tampa.",490,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He charmed them, arranged to meet them at the boat ramp, took them out in his boat, then turned on them with a weapon of some sort. He had used the weapon, along with the women’s fear of water and their unfamiliarity with the bay, to isolate them and keep them under control until they were tied and gagged. Though he had covered the women’s mouths with duct tape, he had left their eyes uncovered so they could see what was happening and so he could enjoy the fear in their eyes. Once they were tied, he probably raped them, weighted them down and pushed them into the water alive, one by one.",491,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The Rogers attack was probably not his first, the profile said, because such predators usually require experience before they are confident enough to approach more than one victim at a time. And because nearly two years had gone by without his being caught, he probably felt confident enough to kill again. Only this time, the profile said, he was likely to have learned from his mistakes in the Rogers case and be more successful at concealing the bodies.

Tell the newspapers and the TV and radio stations what you know and what you’re looking for, and then they will tell the public, and then the public will be on your side, helping you search for this man.

Moore and his team were searching for someone who was almost certainly a serial killer with a taste for murdering more than one victim at a time. If this person were not caught, how many more lives might he claim? Still, the longer the case dragged on, the more difficult it became for the department to reconcile the tension between the desire to make an arrest in the Rogers murders and the need to attend to other cases.",557,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore felt this tension every day as he walked down the halls of the station. To him, it seemed as though he and his investigators were working under a perpetual cloud. He felt he had the support of his immediate superiors, Lt. Gary Hitchcox and Maj. Lois Worlds; Hitchcox, in fact, was devoting himself full-time to the case and was working out of the team’s office. But elsewhere in the department’s hierarchy, there were those who clearly thought the time was approaching when Moore and his team would have to be ordered to let it go.",558,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“We had a tremendous amount of pressure put on us by the administration,” Moore says. “Not to solve the case, but to get off the case.”",559,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"To keep the investigation alive, Moore would have to use every tool at his disposal. It wasn’t enough to be a good detective or a strong supervisor. He had to transform himself into a master salesman, too. That’s why he kept the chain of command well-supplied with updates and progress reports, keeping them happy and off his back. It’s also why he became so adept at manipulating the media.",560,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In the past year, since the FBI had recommended using the media to generate leads, Moore had seen for himself just how useful a bit of coverage could be. He had held several press conferences, given interviews, cooperated with TV producers. With each new round of publicity, tips poured in.",561,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"By now, Moore had learned a great deal about how reporters and editors think, how to get their attention, how to make them do what he needed. He had discovered, for instance, that the media prefer to be fed their news in bite-sized chunks, easy to digest and easy to pass along to the public.",562,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Thinking back to his first press conference, he realized he had overloaded the reporters with too much information. He had given them six or seven items — the FBI profile, the innocence of Hal Rogers, the likelihood that the killer lived in Tampa Bay, to name a few — when any one of those items, by itself, would have been strong enough to make a compelling news story. It would have been better if he had parceled out the items slowly, one or two at a time, over several months. Each piece of information would have gotten better play, and there would have been that many more rounds of stories, generating that many more new tips.",563,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Now he knew better. He understood that reporters were constantly hungry for something fresh.,564,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So he gave it to them, calling press conferences and issuing press releases to detail important developments, different strategies, emerging theories.",566,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore didn’t particularly enjoy talking to reporters. In fact, it made him uncomfortable. But the more coverage he drummed up, the better the chance that the right tip would finally come the team’s way.",567,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The publicity served a second purpose. As long as the Rogers story was in the newspapers and on the evening news, Moore figured, the higher-ups in the police department would be reluctant to pull the plug on the investigation.",568,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The highest of the higher-ups, it turned out, didn’t need to be pressured into supporting the investigation.",569,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Since the Rogers women were killed, there had been a couple of police chiefs in St. Petersburg. Early in 1992, the chief was Ernest “Curt” Curtsinger, and some of the pointed questions about the investigation were reaching his office. So Moore and Lt. Hitchcox sat down with the chief one day and gave him an extensive review of the case, telling him everything they were doing and everything they were still struggling to get done.",570,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Curtsinger listened closely. When they were finished, he turned to Moore.",571,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“How many people do you need?” he asked.,572,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“Four.”,573,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“How about six?”,574,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore was amazed. At that point, there were eight people on his team, including him and Cindy Cummings and J.J. Geoghegan. Now, here was the chief himself approving six more detectives — he also okayed an extra investigator, an agent from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement — and promised them at least six more months to work on the case.",575,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The euphoria was short-lived. Curtsinger had been under attack for some time, accused of insensitivity to minorities. A month after he approved the new detectives for Moore’s team, Curtsinger was fired.",576,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore was left to wonder where the investigation stood. Who would be the next police chief, and how supportive would he be? How much time did the team truly have left before someone pulled the plug?",577,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"All Moore and his investigators could do was keep going until someone told them to stop. By now, more than 1,500 tips had been logged in the case, and the number jumped again late that March, when the investigation was featured a second time on Unsolved Mysteries.",578,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Hundreds of people called, saying they knew someone with a blue and white boat or someone else suspicious that the police should check out. Many of the calls were frustrating. One St. Petersburg woman, for instance, phoned to say she had a sister in Tampa who had wondered for some time if a man who used to live down the street from her had something to do with the murders. The caller suggested that the police phone her sister. A detective did in fact call the sister’s house, but she was not home. The detective left a message, but the sister with the information did not call back.",579,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That was how it went, over and over. At any one time, the investigators were checking out an endless parade of names and numbers and facts, hoping they would finally stumble across the one detail that would blow the case wide open. They had no doubt that the detail was out there.",580,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“This can be solved like any other crime,” Geoghegan would say to Cummings. “All we have to do is work it.”",581,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"After many long months spent trying to understand exactly how Jo and the girls had died, the detectives were now leaning heavily toward the theory that the attack had been carried out by only one person. Cummings, an experienced rock climber who knew something about ropes and knots, had studied the ropes used on the three women. In each case, she observed, the hands had been tied in the same manner. Furthermore, it appeared to her that whoever tied the hands had done the job in a hurry; that was why, she believed, Michelle had managed to work one of her hands loose before she died.",582,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"To Cummings and the other investigators, this evidence pointed toward a single assailant, moving quickly to place Jo and the girls in his control. He had probably held a gun on them, threatened to kill one of them if they moved, promised that everything would be okay if they just did as he told them. Under this theory, the killer had then taped their mouths, removed the clothes from the lower part of their bodies, then tied their feet. After examining the ropes, Cummings had noted that the women’s feet had been bound much more carefully; if their hands were already tied and their mouths taped, he would have had the luxury of taking his time to tie their feet.",583,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"None of this, however, brought them any closer to identifying the killer. To do that, the investigators were focusing increasingly on the handwritten directions found on the Clearwater Beach brochure in the Rogers car. The directions, which told Jo and the girls how to find their motel, were written on the back of the brochure, on the same page as a map of Tampa Bay. Below the map, the writing said:",584,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Originally the detectives had thought that the person who shared the directions had merely been someone helpful who gave the Rogers women assistance and then went on his way. Now the investigators saw it differently. After analyzing the timetable of the women’s last day alive, as well as the psychological profile provided by the FBI, they thought it appeared extremely likely that whoever had given the Rogers women the directions was the same person who had arranged to meet them later at the boat ramp. The man who wrote the directions, then, was almost certainly the killer.",587,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The writing was distinctive, even to a layperson. The man they were looking for printed his letters, with understated R’s and an exaggerated curving hook extending to the left from the bottom of his Y’s.",588,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That May, Moore held another press conference, where he announced the new theory about the killer. He encouraged the media to publish samples of the handwriting, and asked anyone who recognized the writing to please call.",589,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore repeated the investigators’ belief that the killer probably would turn out to be someone charming and likable, someone with a job and a home, someone who appeared respectable and harmless.",590,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Don’t rule out anyone,” he said. “Think about your husband, your boyfriend, your fellow employee.”",591,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was 2 1/2 years since Jo Ann Steffey had clipped the composite drawing from the newspaper, but she had not forgotten about the man who used to live two houses away on Dalton Avenue in her Tampa neighborhood. She had already tried once to report her suspicions. But it bothered her that she’d never seen any proof that her tip was even investigated.",592,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As it happened, someone else had tried to pass along her suspicions. After hearing Jo Ann talk about the neighbor with the blue and white boat, one of Steffey’s sisters had called the police. This was the tip that had been phoned in on that night in March, when the Rogers case was featured on Unsolved Mysteries. Steffey’s sister was the one who had talked to the detective, encouraging her to speak to Steffey. The detective had called Steffey’s house and left a message, but for some reason the message never reached Steffey. Nor had her sister, Steffey says, told her about calling the police.",593,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Steffey felt a connection to Jo Rogers. They shared a similar first name, and just like Jo, Steffey had two daughters. Sometimes she had nightmares about the family. She would see them on the boat and would wake up, her heart pounding.",594,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“It could have been me and my girls,” she would say.",595,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So when she picked up the newspaper the morning after Sgt. Moore’s press conference — it was Thursday, May 14, 1992 — and read the quotes about the handwriting and how it was the key to finding the killer, Steffey found herself wondering if she should report her suspicions again.",596,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The police were saying the killer probably had a job not far from wherever he had met Jo and her daughters. Steffey remembered that her former neighbor was an aluminum contractor who built porches and additions for homes. But she couldn’t remember where his office had been. So she went next door and asked her neighbor, Mozelle Smith, if she did.",597,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Smith had once hired the man to add an aluminum porch to another house she owned in Tampa. She said she thought he worked out of his home. Then something else occurred to her:,598,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Later, looking back on their detective work, Mozelle Smith and Jo Ann Steffey would differ in their recollections of the exact sequence of these events. In fact, in the years that followed there would be a great deal of disagreement about how the two neighbors and those close to them pursued their suspicions concerning the man down the street.",601,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Smith, for instance, would insist that on that day, when the handwriting appeared in the newspaper, she immediately found the aluminum contract filled out by the man. Steffey, meanwhile, would say that the two of them searched through Smith’s house for hours, sifting through the drawers where Mozelle kept her paperwork, but could not find the contract.",602,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Either way, Steffey says she was not deterred. As far as she could tell, she had enough to justify calling the task force. She was still nervous, wondering if she were right, wondering if her former neighbor would learn that she had reported him and if perhaps he had an accomplice who lived nearby. But she picked up the phone anyway.",603,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Steffey talked to Eileen Przybysz, a civilian investigator. Steffey says she told Przybysz about her neighbor and his blue and white boat and the dark-colored sports utility vehicle he had driven. She told how the man had lived in a house on Dalton Avenue along a canal that fed into Tampa Bay, and how her neighbor had hired him for her porch and was searching for the contract. She told how he had moved away suddenly with his wife and little girl two summers ago, and how he had always seemed off to her, made her feel as though he had something to hide.",605,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The two of them, Steffey says, made the comparison right there in the driveway.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Przybysz listened. It would be helpful to see that contract, she said.",617,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“Can you fax it over?”,618,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The contract was faxed, along with the check signed by Chandler. The fax was then attached to the investigator’s notes on Steffey — and put in a stack of other potentially promising tips.",619,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Once again, the task force was overwhelmed with information. Sgt. Moore’s attempts to generate tips were working almost too well. All the investigators could do was check out the tips, one at a time. They would get to Steffey and her suspicions as soon as they could.",620,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore, meanwhile, was preparing for a possible struggle with the new person running the police department. His name was Mack Vines. He had been the chief of the St. Petersburg Police Department in the 1970s, and had gone on to serve as chief of police in Dallas and Charlotte, N.C., before returning to Pinellas County as director of the police academy at St. Petersburg Junior College.",621,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Now Vines was back in charge of the St. Petersburg police, trying to mend a department torn apart by Curtsinger’s controversial tenure and firing. Vines wasn’t the new chief; he had been hired as an assistant city manager to oversee the police department until another chief was found. It was unclear whether Vines would stay in his new job after a chief was hired, but for now he was sitting in the chief’s office on the third floor of the station.",622,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Vines was brought in on May 15, one day after Jo Ann Steffey phoned in her tip. From that day onward, he had his hands full, trying to boost morale and hold the department together in the wake of Curtsinger’s firing. He had a host of things to worry about other than the Rogers case. Still, Moore says, Vines soon made it clear that he was debating whether it made sense to continue devoting so many officers to one investigation.",623,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“We’re not going to continue this case forever,” Moore remembers Vines telling him.",624,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Moore was realistic enough to know that time was limited. But he pointed out to Vines that back in February the task force had been promised at least six more months to work. Those months would be up in mid-August.,625,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"All right, said Vines. He agreed to honor the six-month commitment. But in August, he said, the case would be reviewed to see if the task force should be disbanded.",626,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Years later, Vines would say he doesn’t remember specifically telling Moore that the case would not be continued forever. But he might well have said it, he adds, because it was true. No investigation, Vines says, can be allowed to drag on indefinitely. Either way, he says he knew how hard Moore and the task force were working and was hoping they would develop some strong leads by the August deadline.",629,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That summer, the Rogers investigators made the most of the time that remained before the deadline. Amid the hundreds of phone calls and tips, they were still trying to understand exactly how Jo and the girls had spent their last hours. Their latest theory, as it happened, relied heavily on the idea suggested by Moore’s wife, who had wondered if the family might have been driving in the far right lane of I-275 South in Tampa, and accidentally gotten off at the Dale Mabry exit and then stopped somewhere for directions.",630,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Cummings and Geoghegan thought this idea had merit. For one thing, when the two detectives looked at the directions on the brochure and the map beside it, it appeared that the point of origin for the directions was in fact on Dale Mabry or nearby. Second, the detectives had driven that stretch of I-275 and seen how suddenly the far right lane turned into an exit and how easy it would be for a driver unfamiliar with the road to suddenly veer off the interstate.",631,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As for where the three women might have gone for directions, the investigators thought the most likely answer was a McDonald’s just north of the exit. The fast food restaurant would have been directly in front of them, on the right side of Dale Mabry, making it easy to turn in; it was also a place that would have looked familiar and safe to someone who was lost.",632,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Maybe Moore’s wife was right. Maybe they saw the golden arches and stopped there, hoping to find a map or a soft drink or just a place to use the bathroom. And while they were there, they met the person who wrote the directions on their brochure. Once he wrote the directions, he knew they were staying at the Days Inn, which would have made it easy to arrange a boat ride later in the day.",633,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Maybe he knew they were tourists and therefore easy prey. He could have seen their Ohio tag and struck up a conversation with them, just as the man in Madeira Beach had done with the Canadian tourist when he saw her and her friend in the parking lot of the convenience store.",634,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The detectives drove up and down Dale Mabry, talking to business owners, talking to waitresses, interviewing anyone who might have seen the Rogers women or might know someone with handwriting like the directions on the brochure.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was an unusual idea, suggested by a couple of the detectives, Jim Culberson and Mark Deasaro.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore, open to anything that might work, thought it sounded good. Even better, it was free. Patrick Media Group Inc. agreed to donate the space, and Jim Culberson’s father donated the $ 1,000 required to produce the signs.",641,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In May, the billboards went up around Tampa Bay.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The detectives were not the only ones thinking about new directions for the investigation. Barbara Sheen Todd, a longtime Pinellas County commissioner, had been following the case closely; like so many, she had not been able to forget Jo and her daughters.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Initially Moore was not sure where they would get the money for a second round of billboards. But after Todd told him she would make some calls and take care of it, the two of them worked together to get the new billboards up. Moore doubted the billboards would generate that many leads. However, if more billboards went up with the help of a county commissioner and Moore asked her to join him at another press conference, the media would have a good hook to bite on.",645,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The truth was, the press was growing bored with the Rogers case. When the first billboards had appeared, there had been relatively little coverage. But now, with Todd’s help, Moore was confident that the second billboards would lead to renewed interest in the case. The billboards would be shown on TV and in the newspapers — they were a perfect visual, just the sort of thing editors loved — and the handwriting would be noticed not by a few motorists, but by hundreds of thousands of readers and viewers from all over Tampa Bay.",646,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The strategy went off exactly as planned. With Todd’s encouragement, Patrick Media Group agreed to donate the space a second time, and the new billboards, emblazoned with the handwriting samples, went up on Thursday, July 30. That same day, Moore and Todd stood together at a press conference held in Tampa — this was another strong visual touch — near one of the billboards, erected on Himes Avenue and Columbus Drive, close to the section of Dale Mabry where the investigators believed the Rogers women had met their killer.",647,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Normally our policy is not to discuss evidence, or have the public view evidence, in unsolved homicide cases,” Moore said about the handwriting. ”However, the Rogers case is so unique, and the necessity to capture the killer so compelling, the need to display this evidence overrides normal procedures.”",648,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Mozelle Smith’s daughter was calling as well, pressing to know what had happened to the fax of the contract and check signed by Oba Chandler.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So Smith’s daughter faxed the papers again. This time, though, she threw in a cover letter, bristling with frustration.",658,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Here is another copy of Oba Chandler’s handwriting and on the back of his check is his driver’s license number. Although I’m sure you received numerous samples of handwriting, many of us are convinced that this handwriting is the same as the one published in the papers. We feel so strongly that they are one and the same that due to your lack of response we were tempted to pursue this with a handwriting expert of our own.",659,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Thank you for your assistance.,661,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The letter was difficult to ignore. Przybysz looked at the writing on the contract and on the check. She didn’t know what to think. There wasn’t enough writing on the check to make any comparison, just a signature. As for the writing on the contract, it was blurry.",662,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Przybysz went to Moore and told him that some people in Tampa kept calling, insisting they had the guy. Looking over the notes and the fax, Moore saw that this particular lead was one of many assigned to Geoghegan. It was in his stack of tips still to be checked out.",663,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore called Geoghegan, who was out on the road that day, and asked him to find this woman and get the original.",664,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was Friday, July 31. Two weeks before the deadline.",666,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Geoghegan went to the address in Tampa where Mozelle Smith was waiting. Smith was not in the friendliest of moods. She didn’t want to be interviewed by Geoghegan or anybody else. If anything, she wanted him to answer a few questions. After weeks of trying to get the task force’s attention, she wasn’t sure she should give him the original of the contract. What if they lost it? Hadn’t they already misplaced the first fax that had been sent over?",667,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Geoghegan did his best to reassure her. But Smith wanted something more. Before she gave him the contract, she demanded that he sign a piece of paper acknowledging that he was taking custody of the document. She had a notary public — a friend of her daughter’s — standing by, ready to notarize the piece of paper.",668,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Being on the receiving end of all this was not exactly standard procedure. But what was Geoghegan supposed to do? He signed the paper, watched the notary stamp it and got out of there.",669,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He acknowledges that the tip from the women and their families should have been pursued more quickly. But at the time, he says, the task force was swamped with tips, many of them from people who were sure they had found the killer. Among all the other handwriting samples flowing into the office, the contract with Oba Chandler’s writing was overlooked.",672,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“The handwriting thing did get misplaced. It was in a stack about this high,” says Moore, holding his hand about 6 inches above the table in front of him. “Nobody seems to understand how difficult it was to manage this massive amount of paperwork.”",673,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"But on that summer day in 1992, when Geoghegan returned to the office with the contract, things moved quickly.",674,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and Geoghegan looked back and forth between the contract and the directions on the brochure. They appeared to be written by the same person, but it was hard to be sure. The contract, it turned out, was not the original. It was the customer’s copy, the copy from underneath the original, and the writing was faint.",675,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Still, the resemblance appeared strong – strong enough that the task force had a new suspect and a new focus.",676,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and the others scrambled to learn more about this Oba Chandler. They ran his name in every computer they could think of and quickly discovered that he was 45 years old and living with his wife and daughter across the state in Port Orange, near Daytona Beach.",677,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They learned that Chandler’s old house was on Dalton Avenue, not far from the McDonald’s on N Dale Mabry, and only 2 miles from the boat ramp where Jo and the girls had disappeared. At the time, state records showed, he had owned a 21-foot Bayliner boat, with a blue exterior and white interior. At the time, he was also the registered owner of a dark blue Jeep Cherokee. Furthermore, he had a long criminal record and had been charged with everything from kidnapping to burglary to armed robbery to counterfeiting.",678,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,All of these facts were encouraging. But the investigators did not dare get their hopes up too high; they had been dashed so often before.,679,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Then Marilyn Johnson spoke up.,680,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Johnson was a soft-spoken, older woman, a grandmother who sometimes doted on the other members of the task force. She worked as an office assistant, typing information into the HOLMES computer. She was not a detective, but Moore had encouraged everyone to toss out ideas. So one day, at the end of a meeting on the new suspect, Johnson raised her hand.",681,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,One more thing.,691,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As the investigation raced forward, energized by these discoveries, Marilyn Johnson pointed out something else. Typing files into the computer, she remembered a fact — one fact out of the tens of thousands of stray facts that had been logged over the years — that had escaped everyone else’s memory. The man who had raped the Canadian woman, Johnson pointed out, had told the victim he owned an aluminum company.",692,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Just like Chandler.,693,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That was how they came up with the code name. As they turned their attention to their prey, the members of the task force tried to keep his real name out of their conversations and even their reports. They didn’t want to be paranoid, but they had no desire for the word to get out and for Chandler to learn they were on his trail.",694,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,So they called him by a different name. A name that played off his line of work. A name that was perfect for someone who they suspected had no heart.,695,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,They called him the Tin Man.,696,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Photos of the Rogers girls still hung on a wall of the task force’s office on the second floor of the St. Petersburg police station. The most haunting of these pictures, the one that the members of the task force would talk about long after the case was over, was the Christmas shot.",698,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It had been taken in December 1980, when Michelle was 8 and Christe was 6. They are shown standing side by side in front of the Christmas tree.

But the most striking aspect of the picture is the girls themselves.",699,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They are dressed up, posing for what was clearly the official holiday portrait. Michelle, chin raised, her long hair held back by white barrettes, is wearing a blue velvet jumper over a long-sleeved white blouse; Christe, her bangs hanging past her eyebrows, is in a rose-colored jumper over a white blouse. Both are wearing white knee socks. Both are standing stiffly, hands behind their backs, neither of them smiling as they stare toward the camera.",700,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The photo had been placed on the wall early in the investigation. Now, as the members of the task force turned their attention toward the new suspect, it stayed up.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Michelle and Christe were waiting.,702,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Sgt. Glen Moore and the other investigators knew that a great deal remained to be done before they could arrest Oba Chandler. They were convinced he was the one; they could feel it. But they did not yet have enough hard evidence to make the case stick in front of a judge. At the moment, about all they had was the similarity between Chandler’s handwriting and the writing on the brochure, the proximity of his home to the water and to the boat ramp where Jo and the girls had disappeared, plus Chandler’s strong resemblance to the composite drawing provided by the Canadian woman who had been raped in the boat off Madeira Beach two weeks before the murders.",703,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So far, they didn’t even have enough to charge him in the rape.",704,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They needed much, much more. They needed to put Chandler under the microscope, to learn whatever they could about him, to track down every possible piece of evidence. And they needed to head across the state of Florida to his new home on the east coast, in Port Orange, and place him under surveillance.",705,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Which meant they needed the approval of Mack Vines.,706,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Vines was the assistant city manager running the St. Petersburg police department. As far as Moore was concerned, Vines had never shown much enthusiasm for the Rogers investigation. If anything, Moore thought, Vines seemed tired of it.",707,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Like so many others in the department, Vines was concerned about the time and money that were being devoted to a case that had stymied all the investigators and had shown no sign of moving toward an arrest. Vines had given Moore and his task force until the end of the summer to produce some results. Otherwise, he had said, he would review the status of the investigation and decide what to do with the task force.",708,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,By this point it was mid-August. The deadline was almost up. But now things were different. The detectives on the task force had a strong suspect. They were barreling toward an arrest. Surely Vines would give them more time as well as approval for taking the investigation over to Chandler’s home in Port Orange.,709,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and his immediate superiors, Lt. Gary Hitchcox and Maj. Lois Worlds, went together to Vines’ office to tell him about Chandler.

At the very least, he expected Vines to congratulate them, to tell them how pleased he was that three years of investigation had finally paid off.",710,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,What happened next is the subject of some disagreement. Moore recalls it like this:,711,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Instead of congratulating them, he says, Vines exploded. For the next several minutes, he vented at Moore, telling him he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He said he had thought they were almost done with this case, but no. Here was Moore, saying they had a suspect they wanted to place under surveillance, insisting they needed more time, more money, more support.",712,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“What have you done?” Moore recalls Vines saying. “You’ve backed me into a corner.”,713,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore sat there, stunned at what he was hearing. Beside him, he says, Hitchcox and Worlds appeared to be in shock as well. Maybe they had approached Vines the wrong way or had simply wandered into his office on a bad day. But for whatever reason, the assistant city manager was giving Moore the worst chewing out of his 22 years on the police force.",714,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Vines went on and on. Moore just listened, not sure how to respond. What could he possibly say?",715,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Okay,” he told his boss.",716,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"When he left Vines’ office, Moore’s face was bright red and his veins were popping out of his neck. He was so angry he could barely contain himself. He had to get away, had to go someplace where he could let it out. So he went to the stairwell and climbed to the roof of the police station.",717,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore stood there, looking out over the city, tears streaming down his cheeks.",718,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Today, Vines says he has only a vague recollection of the meeting with Moore and the others. He doubts that he would have exploded — it’s not his style, he says — but does recall a disagreement over exactly how the task force should proceed. As much as he respects Moore, he says the sergeant’s intensity for the Rogers case sometimes made him a challenge for those above him.",719,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Vines called Moore later that day. Moore says the assistant city manager apologized to him for overreacting at the meeting; Vines says he remembers making no such apology. Either way, Vines told Moore that the investigators on the task force would have his support to pursue the new suspect. They could have their extra time. They could go to the east coast and put the suspect under surveillance.",720,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Whatever they needed to get the job done.,721,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In reality, there was no danger of the investigation suddenly halting that day in Vines’ office. From the moment Oba Chandler was identified, there was no turning back.",722,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Suddenly everything in the case accelerated. The task force quickly grew, taking on additional investigators from the St. Petersburg police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, Moore and the others were working closely with prosecutors from the Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney’s Office. The state attorney’s office had been involved in the Rogers case since the first day of the investigation, when the bodies of Jo and Michelle and Christe were pulled from the water. Now, as the task force zeroed in on Chandler, top assistants from the office were meeting with the task force almost daily. Ultimately, it would be up to them to decide whether there was enough evidence to take the case to trial.",723,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and the rest of the detectives were doing their best to gather that evidence. Investigators were fanning out across Florida and into the Midwest, piecing together as much as they could about Chandler.",724,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Chandler had been in trouble with the law since he was a boy. He was a con man and a career criminal, with a slew of aliases and fictitious identities, a prison record, and a history of disturbing, sometimes violent behavior with women. He had joined the Marines, but had deserted shortly afterward. He had been married numerous times — the exact number was difficult to determine — and had fathered eight children with seven women. Through the years, he had claimed to be an X-ray technician, a mechanical draftsman, an apartment manager, an aluminum contractor.",726,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He seemed to enjoy frightening people. He had repeatedly threatened those around him, put them on edge, hurt them.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The basic details of Chandler’s history were easy enough to track down. Born on Oct. 11, 1946, in Cincinnati, a hundred miles or so from where the Rogers women grew up, he was the fourth of five children of Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson. When Oba Jr. was 10, his father hanged himself in the basement of the family’s apartment. One cousin, who attended the funeral, later reported that Oba Jr. jumped into the open grave as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt.",728,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Others in the family would deny this account. Either way, Oba Jr.’s life soon spun out of control. He was stealing cars by age 14 and was arrested 20 times while he was a juvenile. As an adult, he was charged with a long list of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping and armed robbery. Once he was accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman’s window; another time, with receiving 21 wigs stolen from a beauty parlor.",730,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"On another occasion, Chandler and an accomplice broke into the home of a Florida couple and held them at gunpoint while robbing them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and then took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear and tied her up, too. While she lay on the bed, he rubbed the barrel of his revolver across the woman’s stomach.",731,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,The detectives had company with them in Toronto.,761,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Joining them on the trip was one of the assistants from the state attorney’s office. As Halliday and Connor-Dubina questioned the Canadian woman, this prosecutor sat in a nearby hotel room, waiting.",762,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"After the woman had given her statement, the prosecutor carefully questioned her again. He needed to hear her account and study her with his own eyes, so he could evaluate how well her testimony would hold up in court. Now that she had picked out Chandler’s photo, was that enough to make an arrest? To win a conviction?",763,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The prosecutor thought so. The Canadian woman, he believed, was an exceptionally strong witness — articulate and credible, and willing to tell her story in front of a jury.",764,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The time had come to move. The assistant state attorney and his colleagues from the state still wanted more evidence before seeking an indictment against Chandler in the Rogers murders, but there was enough to arrest him for the Madeira Beach rape. It was a serious charge, carrying a possible life sentence. They would use it to get him off the street, then keep strengthening the Rogers case until they had enough to prove those charges as well.",765,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They wrote up an arrest warrant and took it to a judge to be signed. By this point the surveillance units in Volusia County were working around the clock. Keeping track of Chandler’s movements had expanded into a huge operation. Now the task force comprised 40 to 50 law enforcement officers, fielded from the St. Petersburg police, the FDLE and the FBI. They worked out of a command post a few miles from Chandler’s house, taking over an empty business office. Officers had stationed a video camera near Chandler’s house, pointed toward the driveway and front door; a couple of blocks away, they had rented a house and converted it into a small watching post. Members of the task force kept track of a monitor showing them the feed from the video camera. If anyone came out of the Chandler house or pulled up the driveway or ran across the front yard, they would see it immediately.",766,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Whenever Chandler left, he was followed. At any one time, there were as many as six or seven units in unmarked cars assigned to track of his movements. To avoid alerting Chandler to their presence — getting “burned,” the surveillance people called it — they rotated the ground units so that no one vehicle stayed anywhere near him for long.",767,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The FBI had donated the use of two of the bureau’s single-engine Cessnas to assist the ground units. From before dawn till late at night, one of the planes stayed high above Chandler’s house, circling endlessly; when that plane had to refuel or the pilot needed a rest, the two-man team in the other Cessna would take over. If Chandler pulled out of the driveway, whichever plane was in the sky — the air unit was called Eagle — would follow. A spotter seated next to the pilot would watch Chandler’s movements, making sure they stayed with him.",768,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“Okay,” they would say, speaking over the radio to the units on the ground, “Eagle has the eyeball.”",769,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The surveillance was just beginning to settle into a routine when the prosecutors came to Volusia County with the arrest warrant. The plan was to take Chandler into custody on the rape charge. Glen Moore and a couple of other investigators would then try to question him. Moore and the other investigators had a strategy for how to conduct the interview. They had been rehearsing how it would go. They were going to get him in a room at the FBI’s Daytona Beach office and show him photos of Jo and Michelle and Christe, both after they were dead and when they were very much alive. Then, they hoped, he would start to talk.",770,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They were set to go on Thursday, Sept. 17. But that morning, an hour or so before they were to arrest him, something unexpected happened.",771,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Chandler walked out of his house, got into his car, a blue Toyota Corolla, and drove out of town.",772,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“Do you want us to take him down?”,773,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The surveillance teams on the ground were calling the command post on their radios, trying to determine what to do as Chandler got onto Interstate 95 North. Should they arrest him now? Or should they let him drive?",774,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Back at the command post, a debate was under way. Now that the officers had an arrest warrant in hand, some members of the task force thought Chandler should be immediately taken into custody. But others, including Lt. Hitchcox, thought it better to wait. Moore and the other two investigators who would attempt to question Chandler were still preparing for the interview. Besides, none of them could say for sure where Chandler was headed. Maybe he was just making a short trip and would soon be back.",775,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Why not just keep following and see where he goes?,776,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“We’re not gonna stop him,” Hitchcox told the ground units.",777,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So off they went, trailing the blue Corolla, doing their rotations and keeping their distance to avoid getting burned. Above them, one of the FBI’s Cessnas followed overhead, orbiting Chandler’s car as it continued northward along the interstate.",778,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"A little while later, he turned off I-95 and headed west on State Road 40, cutting through the center of the state until he reached I-75 and turned northward again. He stayed on I-75 for a long time. He was a half-hour or so away from the Georgia border when the officers back at the command post in Volusia County decided that the units had followed him long enough. Once he was within a few miles of the state line, they instructed the teams, Chandler was to be stopped and taken into custody.",779,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Before they had the chance, though, Chandler got off the interstate. This time he headed into Lake City, just south of where I-75 intersects with I-10. The surveillance teams followed him as he drove into town and watched him stop at a car stereo business. Falling back to avoid detection, the ground units waited for the blue Corolla to leave.",780,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Right around this time, two things occurred to complicate the surveillance. First, the Cessna that had followed the Corolla up from Volusia County was low on fuel; the crew members needed to break off and find a nearby airport. The second plane quickly arrived to take its place, but by then a thunderstorm was raging in the skies above Lake City, making it harder to keep track of what was happening below.",781,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The ground units were having trouble seeing, too. The heavy rain was obscuring the officers’ view.",782,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Then it happened.,783,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,One of the ground units observed Chandler coming out of the car stereo store and driving away.,784,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"In the sickening moments that followed those transmissions, units scrambled in every direction to find the blue Corolla. They searched north and southward on I-75. They searched east and west on I-10.",794,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,No luck.,795,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The news that they had lost Chandler swept through the task force like another thunderstorm. People were yelling. People were swearing. Some were furious that the decision had been made not to arrest Chandler earlier, when they had the chance in Volusia County.",796,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,A hundred questions and possibilities dangled before them. Had they been burned? Did Chandler spot the surveillance? Or had he just slipped away without any idea that dozens of law enforcement officers were on his tail?,797,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The worst question, the question that would plague the investigators and keep some of them awake for many nights, was this:",798,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,What if their suspect killed someone else?,799,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Glen Moore was frustrated and upset like everyone else. But as far as he could tell, there was no evidence that Chandler had detected the surveillance. Chandler’s wife and daughter were still at the house in Port Orange, which suggested that he was probably coming back.",800,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,The only thing they could do now was wait for him to show up.,801,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So they returned to their Port Orange command post, watched the monitor showing the video surveillance of Chandler’s property, paid close attention to phone calls to the house. As the days passed, a series of calls came in from phone numbers in Cincinnati and from across the Ohio River, in northern Kentucky. The FBI dispatched agents to those locations, but they didn’t find Chandler.",802,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Moore and the others assumed Chandler was visiting old haunts up north. To some of the investigators, this suggested that their suspect was not on the run, but was merely on a trip and would soon be back.",803,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,They kept on waiting.,804,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That Sunday, as usual, Moore went to church. Since he couldn’t go to his own Baptist church back in Pinellas County, he opened the Volusia County phone book and found a Baptist church nearby. Moore asked Cindy Cummings if she wanted to join him. Cindy said yes.",805,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The sermon that particular day at the church was on the subject of forgiveness. The minister talked about how hard it was to forgive, but how crucial, especially when it was hard. He said that even someone who has committed terrible sins — someone like Ted Bundy, he said — can be forgiven if he repents and accepts God into his heart.",806,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"As they sat in the pew, listening to this message, Moore and Cummings could not help but relate it to Oba Chandler. But their responses were completely different. Moore agreed with the minister. He believed that Chandler should be arrested and convicted. Even so, if he truly faced up to his sins and begged God’s forgiveness, Chandler deserved to be saved and spared the torments of hell.",807,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Cummings did not see it that way. Chandler, she believed, had caused too much pain and suffering. Why, there were people out there — Hal Rogers, to name just one — who were still being tortured by Chandler’s cruelty.",808,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"No, Cummings said to herself. No forgiveness. Let him burn.",809,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Then, early on a Thursday afternoon, one week after the surveillance units had lost Chandler in the rain, a call was placed to the house in Port Orange from Georgia. The call was traced to a pay phone just off I-75 in Valdosta, not far from the Florida state line.",811,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Chandler was coming home.,812,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They assumed he would cut across again at some point to I-95 and take it back into Volusia County. So they stationed officers in unmarked cars along the interstate exits, waiting for him to appear. They spotted him at a Port Orange exit. He had just pulled off the highway and stopped at an Amoco gas station when several unmarked units arrived and positioned themselves around his Corolla.",813,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,It didn’t work.,820,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Chandler had been arrested too many times. He knew the routine and was not about to get rattled.,821,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He had short blond hair, blue eyes, the slightly worn face of a longtime smoker. He was a large man, with a barrel-shaped body and huge forearms, but he did not look particularly violent or particularly evil. He didn’t stand out at all.",824,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Not a monster. Just another man.,825,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Halliday drove, while Chandler sat in the back, his hands cuffed behind him. Jim Ramey, the FBI agent who had assisted with the investigation since early 1990, sat on Chandler’s left side.",827,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"By now it was well past dark, and as the car headed westward on I-4, retracing the route that the Rogers women had taken to their deaths in Tampa Bay, Chandler talked away with Ramey.",828,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"It was the longest conversation he would ever have with any member of the task force. He talked about his daughter Whitney and how much he liked taking her to the park. He talked about selling used cars to high school kids, which was how he said he had been earning a living of late. He tried to cut a deal with Ramey, offering to tell authorities about a man whom he claimed was turning back odometers on cars. Ramey was doing his best to give no indication of what they had on Chandler or how much they knew about him. But he could scarcely believe what he was hearing. Here was Chandler, charged with rape and on the verge of being charged with a triple homicide, and yet he expected to make a deal because he had the dirt on some piddling odometer scheme?",829,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Again and again, Chandler complained about the discomfort of having his hands cuffed behind his back. Was that really necessary? Couldn’t they at least cuff him in front?",830,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Ramey thought about Jo and Michelle and Christe and how they were found when they came out of the water. He thought about the concrete blocks around their necks, the rope around their feet, their hands tied behind their backs.",831,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,He told Chandler the handcuffs would stay just as they were.,832,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Chandler’s first hearing was early the next morning, in a little courtroom inside the Pinellas County jail.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"That day, reporters converged on the Rogers farm in Ohio and found Hal outside the barn. He had already heard the news; someone had called him the previous evening. Now, standing in his galoshes and with a feed cap pulled low over his eyes, he didn’t want to tell these strangers who he was. It was an old trick, learned in the months immediately after the murders. When reporters showed up at the farm, Hal would pretend to be someone else and would say that Hal Rogers wasn’t around right now.",834,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"But this time the trick didn’t work. The reporters knew who he was and had no intention of leaving without a comment about the arrest. So Hal gave it to them. After all this time, he said, it was difficult to feel overly optimistic.",835,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"“It sounds good, but they ain’t charged him with nothing,” Hal said.",836,1998,Features

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Proving the Madeira Beach rape was one thing. The victim in that crime had identified Chandler as her attacker. But the Rogers women were no longer alive to identify the man who had taken them out on the water on that night so long ago.,839,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"So far the best evidence the state had for the murders was Chandler’s handwriting and palm print on the brochure. But this only proved that Chandler had met Jo and her daughters, not that he had killed them. There were also the directions Jo had scribbled and left in her car before she disappeared at the boat ramp, suggesting that she and the girls were on their way to meet someone with a blue and white boat. This was incriminating, since Chandler had owned such a boat, but hardly conclusive. At the moment, the prosecution couldn’t even prove that Chandler had taken his boat out on the night of the murders.",840,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The lawyers for the state were hoping to bring in the evidence tying Chandler to the rape, pointing out the similarities between that attack and the murders.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"They talked to one of Chandler’s many children, a woman named Kristal Mays, who told them that her father had unexpectedly paid her a visit in Cincinnati in late 1989, just after the composite drawing was made public. During his visit, Mays said, Chandler had told her that he was on the run. The police in Florida, she remembered him saying, were looking for him in the rape of a woman and for killing some women. He was not specific, she said, but she distinctly recalled his statements and how much they had shocked her.",847,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Kristal’s husband, Rick Mays, said Chandler had made even more incriminating statements to him. According to Rick, his father-in-law had confessed to raping a couple of women in his boat and throwing at least one woman over the side.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"Through all the long months that followed, the prosecutors kept up their search for more evidence. The confessions related by Chandler’s daughter and son-in-law were good but vague. Furthermore, the defense might have some success raising questions about the couple’s motives in stepping forward.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,“It’s a special billing number.”,864,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The number was fictitious. It was used solely for billing purposes to designate marine phone calls. In other words, these collect calls to the Chandler house — calls made on the two key nights of the case — had been placed from someone on a boat, out on the water.",865,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,But who had made them?,866,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,Porter pushed for answers.,867,1998,Features
Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"He learned that whoever placed those phone calls would have had to get on the boat’s radio and call a special marine phone operator. This operator would have then patched the caller through to the house.

He wondered who had been thrown over the side first. Was it the youngest or the oldest? And what about their clothes? They all had been found naked from the waist down.

In recognition of its sprawl and complexity, the Chandler trial would be argued by four seasoned and respected prosecutors — Bruce Bartlett, Bob Lewis, Jim Hellickson and Doug Crow. Working behind the scenes was yet a fifth assistant state attorney, Glenn Martin. Martin’s role was not as glamorous as the others; he had known for some time that during the trial he would not even be sitting in the courtroom.

His diet was a nightmare; he seemed to live on beef jerky, potato chips and Gummy Bears, especially during trials. He frequently was observed talking to himself.

Thomas French,1997-10-01,Angels & Demons,"The state had fought hard for permission to call her. When a defendant is on trial, the jury is rarely allowed to hear testimony regarding any crime other than the one at hand. The principle is simple: If a defendant is to have a fair trial, he should be tried on the evidence in the case in which he is charged, not evidence from some other charge. But in this case, the prosecutors pushed for an exception to that rule. Before the trial, they had argued that details of the rape and of the murders were so similar, they formed a consistent and identifiable pattern that proved the same person had committed both crimes. And to establish that pattern, they said, evidence from the rape should be allowed into the trial. Over the defense’s fervent objections, Judge Schaeffer agreed.",1011,1998,Features

It was Michael whose body was strong enough for a transplant, Michael whose sister Megan was a genetic match, Michael who slept while marrow dripped through a tube into his body. In the hospital, John visited his brother and hung back, transfixed by the sight of Michael's bald head and puffy face. ""You're going to have a transplant too,"" Denise told John. Back in the hotel room, she assembled a makeshift kitchen to cook the low-fat foods recommended to fight John's disease. She plugged in an electric skillet to make chicken breaded with fat-free cornflakes. She scrubbed dishes in the bathroom sink.

Her biggest fault may have been that she took too long in the shower -- and you never knew what color her hair was going to be when she emerged.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Even before that, Ryan and her older sister Tina had become alarmed. After a party in December, Cartier got annoyed with Rose for not wanting to eat pizza he'd just bought. She began walking back to the party when he backhanded her in the face so hard she fell down.

Whether she loved it, despised it or was painfully ashamed of it . . . she couldn't stand the thought of these little parts of her being taken away and put into someone else's possession.""",69,1993,

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"She met Cartier last Jan. 30 at a Boston nightclub called Axis, having gone there with Lauren Mace, Kristin's roommate and best friend, and Lauren's boyfriend. At Axis, Kristin recognized Cartier as someone she'd seen at Bunratty's, a hard-rock club where Cartier had been a bouncer. Cartier was easily recognizable; he had a large tattoo of a castle on his neck.",71,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"What did she see in him? It's a question her parents keep asking themselves. But some things are fairly obvious. He reminded her of Jason, her friend from New Zealand. He could be charming. ""People felt a great deal of empathy for him,"" said Octavia Ossola, director of the child care center at the home where Cartier grew up, ""because it was reasonably easy to want things to be better for him."" At the Harbor School, said executive director Art DiMauro, ""he was quite endearing. The staff felt warmly about Michael.""",72,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"So, at first, did Kristin. ""She called me up, really excited and happy,"" said Christian Dupre, a friend since childhood. ""She said 'I met this good guy, he's really nice.' """,73,1993,

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Her friends say they got along well at first. He told Kristin he'd been in jail for hitting a girlfriend, but called it a bum rap. She did not know he'd attacked Rose Ryan with a scissors, that he had a rap sheet three pages long.",78,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Kristin, friends say, often made excuses for his behavior. But they soon started to argue. Cartier was irrationally jealous, accusing her of going out with men who stopped by just to talk. During one argument, apparently over her art, Cartier hit her, then did his ""usual thing"" and started crying.",79,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Cartier, meanwhile, was still bothering Ryan. A warrant for violating probation had been issued out of Boston Municipal Court on Dec. 19, in part for trying to contact her by mail while he was in jail. But when he finally turned up in court, a few days before he met Kristin, he got kid-glove treatment. Rather than being sentenced to complete the one-year term he'd gotten for the scissors attack, he was ordered instead to attend a once-a-week class at the courthouse for six weeks called ""Alternatives to Violence.""",80,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"""It's not a therapy program, it's more educational,"" said John Tobin, chief probation officer at Boston Municipal Court.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"What Tobin didn't mention was that Cartier had actually dropped out of his Alternatives to Violence course -- and, incredibly, was allowed to sign up for it again. According to a chronology I obtained elsewhere, Cartier attended the first meeting of the group on Feb. 5 and skipped the class Feb. 12. His probation was revoked two days later. But instead of sending him back to jail, the court allowed him to start the course over, beginning April 1.",82,1993,

Cartier's record of psychiatric problems, his admissions to the Boston mental health center in January and April 1991 and his reliance on a drug to control manic-depression should have disqualified him from the court-run violence program.",85,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"""If we had information that he had a prior history of mental illness, or that he was treated in a clinic or that he had been hospitalized, then what we probably would have done is recommend that a full-scale psychological evaluation be done for him,"" Tobin told the Boston Herald last June following Kristin's murder. ""We didn't know about it.""",86,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Probation officer Tom Casey in Brighton knew. All Tobin's office had to do was pick up the phone to find out what a menace Cartier was. Meanwhile, in Salem, where she had moved to work with her sister at a family-run business, Rose Ryan remained fearful. But she had a new boyfriend, Sean Casey, 23, and, as Rose puts it, ""I think he intimidated Mike because he had more tattoos. Mike knew Sean from before.""",87,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Around March 1, Sean went to Boston to tell Cartier to leave Rose alone. As they were talking, Kristin walked by. Sean didn't know who she was, but recognized her later, from newspaper photos.",88,1993,

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"As the weeks wore on, they started to argue.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"""He hit her once. She freaked out on that . . . ,"" Bekky Elstad said. ""She wanted him to get counseling . . . . He told her he was sorry. He was all broken up. She wanted to believe him.""",91,1993,

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"When she got back to Boston, Cartier tried to make up with her. He gave her a kitten. ""It was really cute -- black with a little white triangle on its nose,"" Amber Lynch said. ""It was teeny. It just wobbled around.""",93,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"It didn't last long. Over Kristin's protests, Cartier put the kitten on top of a door jamb. It fell off, landing on its head. She had to have it destroyed.",94,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Devastated, Kristin called home in tears and told her parents, for the first time, about her new boyfriend. Part of her conversation with her mother was picked up by a malfunctioning answering machine.",95,1993,

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"But Cartier kept trying to get her on the phone. He warned her not to go to the police and for a while, she didn't. She felt sorry for him.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Kristin was furious. She promptly called Cartier's probation officer, Diane Barrett Moeller, and gave her an earful: the exercise machine, the beating.",119,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Kristin's call for help was another of the probation office's secrets. Tobin said nothing about it to the Boston press in the days after Kristin's murder, when it grew clear that there was something desperately wrong with the criminal justice system.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Tobin also claimed that his office could have taken no action because Kristin was ""not the woman in the case we were supervising,"" which is like saying that probationers in Boston Municipal Court should only take care not to rob the same bank twice.",123,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"The next day, Friday, May 8, instead of moving to revoke Cartier's probation, Moeller called Cartier and, in effect, told him what was up. Tobin recalled the conversation. ""She told him to get the exercise machine back to her. She told him she didn't want to hear about it any more.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Kristin was skeptical about that. And she was worried about more violence. The warnings of her friends, her brother Charlie, her teacher Ross Ellenhorn and now Cartier's probation officer rang in her ears. Her art reflected her anguish. She had painted her own self-portrait, showing some of the ugly bruises Cartier had left. Hanging sculptures showed a male, arms flexed and fists clenched. The female hung defensively, arms protecting her head.",127,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"By Monday, May 11, she had made up her mind. She was going to rely on the system. She decided to ask the courts for help.

Simmons, afraid she might not come back, made out an ""application for complaint"" himself and got a judge on night duty to approve issuance of a one-day emergency restraining order over the phone.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Other paperwork that Simmons sent over to the courthouse, right next door to the police station, called for a complaint charging Cartier with assault and battery, larceny, intimidation of a witness and violation of the domestic abuse law.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Shubow was unaware of the criminal charges hanging over Cartier's head at the May 12 hearing. And Shubow didn't bother to ask about his criminal record. Restraining orders in Massachusetts, as in other states, have been treated for years by most judges as distasteful ""civil matters."" Until Kristin was killed, any thug in the Commonwealth accused under the domestic abuse law of beating up his wife or girlfriend or ex-wife or ex-girlfriend could walk into court without much fear that his criminal record would catch up with him. Shubow later told the Boston Globe, ""If there is one lesson I learned from this case, it was to ask myself whether this is a case where I should review his record. In a case that has an immediate level of danger, I could press for a warrant and immediate arrest.""",136,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Instead, Shubow treated Docket No. 92-RO-060 as a routine matter.

'I Had This Gut Feeling' Downtown, in Boston Municipal Court, chief probation officer Tobin said that ""if we had found out about the restraining order, we would have moved immediately."" But Tobin's office made no effort to find out. Cartier's probation officer knew that the anonymous female caller lived in Brookline; a call to officials there would have made clear that Cartier had once again violated probation by beating up an ex-girlfriend. No such call was made.",138,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"Apparently, the probation officer didn't ask Cartier for the details either.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"The hearing lasted five minutes. It would have been shorter except for a typical bit of arrogance from Cartier, trying to stay in control in the face of his third restraining order in 18 months. He agreed not to contact Kristin for a year and to stay away from her apartment and school. But he said he had a problem staying away from Marty's Liquors, where Kristin had just started working as a cashier. ""I happen to live right around the corner from there,"" Cartier complained, according to a tape of the hearing.",152,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"The judge told him to patronize some other liquor store, but not before more argument from Cartier about how he would have to ""walk further down the street"" and about how close it was to Bunratty's, only half a block away.",153,1993,
George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"McGill ended the hearing by ordering Cartier to avoid any contact with Kristin, to stay at least 200 yards away from her and not to talk to her if he had to come closer when entering his home or the nightclub. And with that, Cartier walked out scot-free. Yet, Massachusetts law, enacted in 1990, provides for mandatory arrest of anyone a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe violated a temporary or permanent restraining order. In addition, a state law making ""stalking"" a crime, especially in violation of a restraining order, had been signed by Gov. Weld just the day before, May 18, effective immediately.",154,1993,

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,"On the afternoon of May 28, she and Robert Hyde, a friend who had just graduated from BU, decided to get something to eat after playing Scrabble (Kristin won) and chess (Robert won) at Kristin's flat. The two hopped on the back of his Yamaha and were off. First stop was the Bay Bank branch on Commonwealth Avenue, two doors from Marty's Liquors. As they turned a corner, Kristin saw Cartier looking in Marty's window. ""Did you see that?"" she asked Hyde moments later as they got off the bike. ""Mike was peeking in the window.

We talked about summer school, her Museum School evaluation and a half dozen other things, including the next month's check from home. I assured her it was in the mail. She had a big smile in her voice. All I knew about Cartier was that she had gotten rid of the creep.

George Lardner Jr.,1992-11-22,The Stalking of Kristin,Cartier must have seen her and hid in a doorway or alley until she passed by him. Witnesses said he came at her from behind and shot into the rear of her head from a distance of 15 or 20 feet. Then he ran into a nearby alley.,185,1993,

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"They were a small prayer group—a rising-star preacher, an elderly minister, eight women, one young man, and a little girl. But to him, they were a problem. He believed that, as black Americans, they were raping “our women and are taking over our country.” So he took out his Glock handgun and calmly, while their eyes were closed in prayer, opened fire on the 12 people gathered in the basement of Mother Emanuel AME Church and shot almost every single one of them dead.",2,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"At the trial last December, two survivors and the many relatives of the victims sat in a courtroom and looked at the back of Dylann Roof's head, the thinness of his neck. The ever growing bald patch at the center of his bowl cut almost made him look like a young, demented monk with a tonsure. He was dressed in the sort of getup that a man wears when life hasn't presented him with many opportunities to wear a suit: a worn crewneck sweater and thick polyester khakis that hung low over cheap-looking brown leather dress shoes.",3,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"During two stages of his trial, Dylann Roof decided to represent himself. When family members of the victims testified, they listened to him, without looking over, as he lifted himself weakly from his chair and dismissed them from the stand with his deep, always bored, blunt voice, which sounded like his mouth was full of Karo syrup. He didn't object often, but when he did it was because he was bothered by the length and the amount of testimony that the families offered. Could they keep their stories about the dead quick? Whenever he stood to be walked back to his holding cell, his mouth moved with what I first thought was a sigh or a deep exhale—really, it was an ever present twitch, a gumming of his cheeks that sometimes ended with his tongue lolling out and licking his thin lips.",4,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Felicia Sanders, one of the few survivors, told the courtroom early on that Roof belonged in the pit of hell. Months later, she said that because of him she can no longer close her eyes to pray. She can't stand to hear the sound of firecrackers, or even the patter of acorns falling. Because of Dylann Roof, Felicia Sanders had been forced to play dead by lying in her dying son's blood, while holding her hand over her whimpering grandbaby's mouth. She had pressed her hand down so tight that she said she feared she would suffocate the girl. Eighteen months later, Felicia Sanders pointed that same hand toward Dylann Roof in the courtroom and said, with no doubt in her voice at all, that it was simple—that man there was “pure evil.”",5,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Their vitriol was warranted but also unexpected, since in most of the press coverage of the shooting it had largely been erased. Almost every white person I spoke with in Charleston during the trial praised the church's resounding forgiveness of the young white man who shot their members down. The forgiveness was an absolution of everything. No one made mention that this forgiveness was individual, not collective. Some of the victims and their families forgave him, and some of them did not. No one acknowledged that Dylann Roof had not once apologized, shown any remorse, or askedfor this forgiveness. Or the fact that with 573 days to think about his crime, Dylann Roof stood in front of the jurors and, with that thick, slow tongue of his, said without any hesitation whatsoever, “I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.”",6,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"On the first morning that Felicia Sanders testified, I was seated directly behind Dylann Roof's mother, and because she is skin and bones, it was apparent that she was having some kind of fit. She trembled and shook until her knees buckled and she slid slowly onto the bench, mouth agape, barely moving. She said, over and over again, “I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.” She seemed to be speaking to her boyfriend, but maybe it was meant for Felicia Sanders, who was soon to take the stand. A communiqué that was a part of the bond that mothers have, one that was brought up by the radiant shame one must feel when your son has wreaked unforgivable havoc on another mother's child. Whatever it was, it was Gothic.",7,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"When Dylann Roof's mother fainted in the courtroom, a reporter from ABC and I called for a medic, and not knowing what else to do, I used my tissues to put a cold compress on her forehead and started dabbing it—before I felt out of place, or realized that I was too much in place, inside of a history of caretaking and comforting for fainting white women when the real victims were seated across the aisle, still crying. But even during all of this chaos, this pain that made the courtroom feel swollen with grief, Dylann Roof did not appear to look back at his very own mother.",8,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"After Roof was found guilty, they went up to the podium, one by one, when it was time for the victim-impact testimony, and standing near the jury box, they screamed, wept, prayed, cursed. Some demanded that he acknowledge them. “Look at me, boy!” one raged. He did not. Others professed love for him. He did not care. Some said they were working the Devil from his body. Feel it, they shouted. He did not appear to feel anything.",9,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"I had come to Charleston intending to write about them, the nine people who were gone. But from gavel to gavel, as I listened to the testimony of the survivors and family members, often the only thing I could focus on, and what would keep me up most nights while I was there, was the magnitude of Dylann Roof's silence, his refusal to even look up, to ever explain why he did what he had done. Over and over again, without even bothering to open his mouth, Roof reminded us that he did not have to answer to anyone. He did not have to dignify our questions with a response or explain anything at all to the people whose relatives he had maimed and murdered. Roof was safeguarded by his knowledge that white American terrorism is never waterboarded for answers, it is never twisted out for meaning, we never identify its “handlers,” and we could not force him to do a thing. He remained inscrutable. He remained in control, just the way he wanted to be.",10,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"And so, after weeks in the courtroom, and shortly before Dylann Roof was asked to stand and listen to his sentence, I decided that if he would not tell us his story, then I would. Which is why I left Charleston, the site of his crime, and headed inland to Richland County, to Columbia, South Carolina—to find the people who knew him, to see where Roof was born and raised. To try to understand the place where he wasted 21 years of a life until he committed an act so heinous that he became the first person sentenced to die for a federal hate crime in the entire history of the United States of America.",11,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Dylann had always preferred Charleston. Charleston had history. It was once home to the most enslaved people in the country. It was a city full of relics and buildings that reminded him of a time when white men were mighty, and the masters of their dominions, a time when they had prevailed. Not like his hometown. Not like Columbia.",12,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Dylann Roof's father lives on a dead-end street at the edge of Columbia, across from a lot that is as vast and empty as the end of the world. Behind the lot, there is a small apartment building that is lit up with too many halogen lights, probably to keep people from loitering and doing the dumb shit people do when they think nobody can see them. But that's it. There is nothing else at the end of the street except the Roofs' little house.",13,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"The house itself is well made. Low-slung, yellow, a Craftsman-style bungalow. It is in a nice enough neighborhood, but still looks like a place where people go when their dreams elsewhere have washed up and gone dry. On the mailbox, there is a route sign: end 1 key west. And on the door there are two faded Ron Jon Surf Shop stickers and a smaller, “I Voted” sticker. Someone has tied an American flag to the tree out front. The decals, the rusted wind chimes, and the slightly mildewed lawn furniture give the house the feel of one man's Margaritaville.",14,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"I stood there across the street, lying in wait. Waiting for what? An answer. A reason. A detail I could take with me to help make sense of impossibly awful things. Wrapped in that moonless night, I knocked on the door of the yellow house, and in the confusion of having an unknown black woman at his door a few hours before midnight, wanting to talk about his son, Bennett Roof let me come in and handed me an ice-cold beer that tasted like relief in my paper-dry mouth, parched from nerves.",15,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"And then I took a seat on the couch where his son used to sleep, feet away from the computer where his son wrote his explanation of why he had to kill nine black people, feet away from the file cabinet where Dylann Roof sometimes stored his jacket with its flag patches from African apartheid states. Bennett Roof was wary but kind. He watched me closely while I petted the affectionate mackerel tabby cat that his son had taken so many pictures of but still left behind. I watched him closely when I asked him to make sense of something that he said he could not. In a living room full of paintings of Florida and parrots, all that Dylann Roof's father could say, over and over again, was: “I don't know what happened, I just know that the boy wasn't raised that way.”",16,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Even when I pushed him, he said it again, and then he shook his head and kept saying it until he asked me to leave, with the sad look of a man who wanted any other life than this one. After Dylann did what he did, there was no going back to Key West, or to some easy before. There was just this, just intrusions from strangers who wanted an answer and felt the nature of his son's crime warranted one—and just Benn Roof letting his two giant Rottweilers out the front door to track me and to make sure I'd gone back into the dark street and the black night I'd come from.",17,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Benn Roof never showed up at his son's trial. (Contacted later, Benn Roof declined to participate in this story further, describing it as “fake news.”) In Dylann's farewell note to his father, found torn out of a journal in the backseat of his car, there is no nostalgia. It is devoid of a loving tone, except to say to his father that he was a good dad. In the card Benn Roof gave his son just four months before, for his 21st birthday, there is that same terse tone. Benn told his only son that he was proud of him, and here was an IOU for $400, so that Dylann could finally apply for a permit and purchase a gun.",18,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"It is as if he floated through people's lives leaving nothing for them to recall. One teacher who spent time with him in her classroom every day says that she typically has a good memory, but she apologizes because she really can't remember anything about him. He did absolutely nothing that would trigger any attention except that he compulsively used hand sanitizer. Dylann Roof emptied bottles and bottles of the stuff into his hands, so much so that it became something of a running joke in class that Dylann could not do anything, not even go to lunch, until he had disinfected and scrubbed his hands clean. As if he were aware of some stain or some filth that others did not see.",19,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"In the aftermath of the murders, many of Roof's former classmates rushed to do interviews. This infuriated Roof, who cautioned in his journal: “Many of the people who claimed to have known me, I have never heard of in my life.

Their mothers' bond pushed the boys together. Yes, Dylann knew he was black, and it didn't alter things. Dylann even once asked him about his brown skin, as kids will do. They had similar interests—skateboarding, wrestling, video games. So after school, they regularly hung out together, even though Caleb found Dylann to be slow-witted.",24,2018,

And it wasn't just books; in everything he was just…dull,” he said. “He wasn't really street-smart. Let's say we were at the park, and we had to run away, he'd be kinda slow on getting what we needed to do.” As they grew older and their interests diverged, Dylann wasn't the sort of kid you took along with you, because “he just wasn't with it.”",25,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Caleb, a musician and rapper, is thin and tall. The two times we talked, he was dressed in a uniform of red-gold-and-green Adidas shell toes, a punk T-shirt, skinny jeans, and an oversize bomber jacket. He had thick dreadlocks that reached his shoulders. The second time we spoke, he wore gleaming gold grillz. This is to say, he looks cool, and it makes sense that puberty became a schism between them and that they hadn't seen each other in years.",26,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"They were so estranged by the time of the murders that when Caleb read Roof's writings, what shocked him was not just the hatred but also that the dull, slow kid he knew could even string together a coherent collection of thoughts: “For a long time, I thought Dylann had to have read someone else's writing or been coached, because the kid I knew couldn't write or even think like that.”",27,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"When I told one of Roof's teachers that I'd been in touch with some of his classmates, the mention of Caleb delighted her. This happened with many people, including with Dylann's mother. She was the only person besides Caleb who confirmed that the two boys had ever been friends. (Otherwise, Amelia Roof declined to participate in this story.) Their teacher said, “Maybe Dylann's mother wanted him to be close with Caleb, but I can't really see it.”",28,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Dylann and Caleb's elementary-school principal, Ted Wachter, administered Rosewood Elementary for three decades. Before that, he grew up in Queens, and he still has a strong New York accent even after 30 years in South Carolina. At his home in Columbia, he sat in a tall chair that made him look magisterial, but his gestures softened it all into the swagger of a liberal-arts professor. After he and his wife handed me a bowl of pistachios and a glass of white wine, Wachter, who talks fast and without shyness, asked me if I wanted to hear his theory on what happened to Dylann Roof. He started at the very beginning. Back when he heard on the radio about “this tragedy in Charleston” and the name Dylann Roof came up, Wachter thought to himself, Hell, I know that name.",29,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Dylann showed up at Rosewood at the age when social relationships become “class driven” and start to “self-sort.” Wachter, who has a background in sociology, watched in dismay as “those black-white relationships also started fraying. They just broke up, and I don't think anyone wanted it to, but the social pressures are so strong.",30,2018,

I always remember thinking, ‘This is a nice, handsome-looking boy.’ I'll show you his picture in the yearbook. Handsome, cute, but quiet, and he never was in my office for trouble. He was very quiet, and he wasn't part of the in crowd, which was more…the kids of college-educated families. He wasn't part of that. He was with the working-class kids.",31,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"“To understand Dylann, you need to read The Hidden Injuries of Class,” Wachter said. What that book revealed was “how white working-class people in Boston, in South Boston, the more you interviewed them, what came out, especially after a few beers, is how inferior they felt to all the Harvard, Cambridge, bright, educated people.” In Wachter's mind, Dylann wasn't stupid, but he felt displaced. It was a case of class resentment. “And here's the funny thing: If I had a dinner party right here with just white Ph.D.'s, it would not be socially acceptable for me to make any slur to an African-American person or a Hispanic person or a Muslim, but if I refer to poor whites as rednecks—”",32,2018,

They sorted through them until they found what they were looking for. The three of us huddled around and peered at a picture of a young, small, diverse class full of smiling black students and a few smiling white students, as well. The students were grouped together, with clear affection, elbows on each other's backs, almost hugging, giggling with ease. And then I found him. Off-center, straining at a smile, with sad eyes, standing to the side, in a natty-looking red jacket, with his bowl-cut blond hair, already looking like a boy apart.",39,2018,

He did cursory studies of his family online. I'd been curious about what he might have found and so I spent time in the archives in Columbia, learning what I could about his ancestry.",40,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"The Roofs of the 19th century were not what anyone would call an illustrious family, but they did well enough in Columbia to be recorded in local history books as diligent churchgoers and good citizens. Dylann's great-great-great-grandfather played a minor role in the Civil War: Jesse Marion Roof had planned to become a minister, and would have if the Civil War hadn't interrupted his studies. Instead, he married a woman named Tarsy in 1859, and three years later, he enlisted in the Confederate army as a corporal. He was put on boat duty and ran water to Morris Island, which is best known as the site of the horrendous defeat of the first black members of the Union army. But these were not remarkable lives. If anything, they were wholly typical. They were so typical that when I was at a local library, the only thing that caught my eye about Roof's early ancestor was that when Jesse Marion and Tarsy Roof's household was tallied for the census, along with their names there was listed in the household a small “mulatto” child.",41,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"“I wish with a passion that n——s were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves,” Dylann wrote on his website, TheLastRhodesian.com. Although all white Americans have benefited from the centuries of free black labor, it is true that the majority of white southerners were in no position to own anything or anyone. Dylann Roof's ancestors also had very little, but they owned a child, an enslaved girl. There was no first name listed, but her last name was Roof, and she was 8.",42,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"I spent the weeks in the courtroom looking at him and wondering about her. If she was purchased, she was purchased as a child who was close to incapable of doing much work. And with no other enslaved people in the household, why was it just her? Who was her mother? Who was her father? Or was she the product of the rape of an enslaved woman, which, of course, could very well make her Dylann Roof's ancestor, a most American part of his pure blood? The fact that he felt like he knew so much about race but didn't know about her is why, in all of Dylann's investigations into his family, in all of his interpretations of history and his rants against race mixing, there is the cognitive dissonance of a man looking for what never was, especially in this country: any kind of racial purity in the first place. Bennett Roof was in his mid-20s when he met Amelia. Amelia, who went by Amy, worked at a bar called the Silver Fox. She was a waifish, young divorcée, only 29, a bartender with blonde hair that was so long that some people said it went down to her ankles. It did not, but she must have looked just like a pale version of that country singer Crystal Gayle. Did Benn sense that Amy, too, came from a family that fared better in the before? Or did they sense the social decline they were both caught in and seek to plunge into it together, hand in hand? Amelia Roof came from a prominent Yankee family that had moved south to the Carolinas in the early 1800s, but by the time she was born, none of the education, wealth, or class seemed to have trickled down. Dylann’s paternal grandparents were people full of promise (he is now a well-respected, solidly middle-class real estate lawyer in Columbia; she does not work), but they had what their grandson did not: educations and an assurance that their social class and their whiteness would mean that they belonged.",43,2018,

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"In his “manifesto,” Dylann says that it is absurd to suggest that being the child of a divorce means that he had a hard life, since many people are the products of divorce. But Dylann wasn't really the product of divorce. His parents weren't together when he was born; Dylann was either an accident or a love child. And the reunion did not last. For Amy, there were five addresses in just as many years—more addresses than almost seem possible. Maybe those many moves explain why no one remembers much about Dylann Roof as a boy.

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"That Dylann Roof walked into a church and brought such violence into a sanctuary was the detail that most white people I met in South Carolina found so disturbing. That the church was predominantly black and he was white was an aside to them. To harm anyone in a church is something that you just don't do. Church is the center of one's moral education and basis for one's life, they told me.

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"This black body of mine cannot be furtive. It prevents me from blending in. I cannot observe without being observed. At Dylann Roof's church, I was greeted warmly at the door by a young white woman and a middle-aged white man. But when I entered the chapel and was seated in a rear row, many eyes turned on me, making me feel like I was a shoplifter trying to steal from their God. Was it because I didn't know the hymns, because I didn't take Communion, or was it because I was black? I do not know.",47,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"After the service, I told Dylann's pastor, Tony Metze, how uncomfortable I felt being there. And even though he didn't really have much time, Metze agreed to give me a few minutes to talk. For as long as Roof was held at the Al Cannon Detention Center, Metze continued to visit him, and a few days after our interview in Columbia, Metze also attended the trial with Roof's grandparents. When the murders occurred, Metze was approached by lawyers to ask kids who knew Dylann what they remembered about him, but none of them remembered much.",48,2018,

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Out of everyone, it was his grandfather who was closest to Dylann, Metze said. “He just would not give up on Dylann. Dylann just doesn't talk, so I think his grandfather did what grandfathers do: spend time with him, hope and pray I can nourish and strengthen this kid, bring something out in him.” C. Joseph Roof, Dylann's grandfather, would later tell the court at Roof's state trial that he and his wife prayed for the victims' families every day. He said they were very sorry, but he also implored people to remember that “nothing is all bad, and Dylann is not all bad. There’s no way we could ever feel what they’ve felt and what they’ve lost, just as no one can understand what we’ve been through.”",50,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"When I got the opportunity, I asked Metze about what happened to me in his church, if it was indicative of a larger inability to deal with race and racism.

I went out the way I came in, but the doors were locked. The lights had even been turned off. But gleaming on a windowsill was a plastic laminated binder labeled “St. Paul's Safety & Security Plan.” I opened it. It contained instructions for the greeters, the same people who had welcomed me at the door. Without knowing what I was looking for, I started to read: “Shocking events reported in the media can cause congregations to take immediate action on emergency and security issues, but emergency planning is a long-term process.… If a questionable unknown visitor arrives, be polite, engage in conversation, steer him/her to a rear row seat where you can have an Usher assigned to keep an eye on him/her.… Threats can come in many forms.… You are the eyes and ears for the Safety/Security program at St. Paul's.” I flipped through all of it, but the St. Paul's safety binder had no instructions for what to do if the shooter was one of their own.",59,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"For two months in 2014 and 2015, Roof worked for Clark's Termite & Pest Control in Irmo.

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"In February 2015, four months before the murders, an ad with a picture of a young man appeared on Craigslist. Roof was anonymously looking for a companion to join him on a tour of historic Charleston, and he was seeking anyone except “Jews, queers, or n——s.” The foulness and bigotry of the ad caught the eye of Dr. Thomas Hiers, a retired psychologist. He reached out to Roof to try to help him, but in their exchanges Roof continued to use the same hateful, derogatory language. Hiers offered to pay Roof to watch TED talks, because he felt Roof needed an expanded worldview or, as he later explained to Roof's lawyers, “a different way of looking at the world.” Roof replied to thank Hiers and told him that he seemed like a nice man, but he refused the help because “I am in bed, so depressed I cannot get out of bed. My life is wasted. I have no friends even though I am cool. I am going back to sleep.”",62,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"The day after the murders, while talking to FBI agents, Roof described a life that sounded cloudy with the same haze of idleness his co-workers spoke of. What were his days like? They were a blur. There was a day spent at the movies; and the day of the “incident”—but he could not remember which day he had done what. Roof told them that he did not own a cell phone and that the few “friends” he did have were kids he'd reconnected with in the months before the shooting, when he went to a local library and used the computer there to create a Facebook account. He added 88 “friends,” and the majority of them were black kids who went to high school with him.

When Roof found him again, Joey was living in a rented trailer in the unincorporated area outside Columbia with his mother, his girlfriend, Lindsay Fry, and his two younger brothers, Justin and Jacob. As the summer passed, Dylann would start to crash there at times. Later, Joey would do a flurry of interviews in which he described his friendship with Roof and explained why having a friend he hadn't seen in years stay in an already crowded trailer wasn't at all strange.

It was drizzling when I pulled into the Hideaway Park development, and a man whose face I could not see stepped out of the shadows. He was dressed in an oversize hoodie and was carrying a small pit-bull puppy in his arms. He walked out toward the road without saying a word to me, even when I asked him if he knew the Meeks. Out front, there was a child's play kitchen with a sink full of stagnant, reedy water and a white car whose whole front had been sideswiped and deeply dented.",65,2018,

Even in the trailer, Roof kept to himself. Meek's mother noticed that at times Roof would get agitated and retreat to his car, where he would blast classical music and opera to quiet his nerves. But what had made him so upset remained unknown.",66,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"In most of Roof's friends' accounts, there is one indisputable fact: That summer, they all did a lot of drinking and a lot of pot smoking. Roof had already been arrested the year before for possession of a Schedule III controlled narcotic. He was stalking employees at the Columbiana Centre Mall and asking them “out of the ordinary questions.” When police responded to a call, they searched him and found a “small unlabeled white bottle containing multiple orange in color square strips.” Suboxone is typically used to wean opioid addicts off their dependence, but it can also give non-addicts a sense of euphoria, coupled with intense nausea.",67,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"In his jailhouse journal, Dylann wrote: “I don't like it when people try to read into things, or try to find, or create meaning that isn't there. I don't like it when people put so much weight on the things I say. Sometimes, more now than before the incident, I feel that the people I talk to hang on my words as if they were all important or offer some sort of insight into my being. But this isn't the case; it never is with anyone. For example, I stated before I never used drugs to ‘drown the pain,’ or ‘self medicate.’ I used drugs because they get you high. There is no deeper meaning behind this. There is no deeper meaning behind any of my behavior.”",68,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"One person who spent time in the trailer park with Roof agreed to talk with me on the condition that I didn't name them. When I asked what was most memorable about Roof, the answer came quickly: “He was quiet, uncomfortably quiet, strangely quiet. I mean really strange.” But in this wasteland, with this group of listless friends, Roof could talk about shooting up a college, brandish his gun, use racist slurs, all without being considered outlandish. These instances evaporated into their ears as liquored-up loose talk. To this day, Roof's friends seem to have a striking inability to process the gravity of what he did. They have said things like: “He would talk about killing people, but none of us took him seriously.”",69,2018,

That's standard practice.” Without any reply from the FBI, on April 16, Dylann Roof walked out of Shooter's Choice with his gun and five magazines of bullets.",81,2018,

Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"The hatred animated him. The dots that connected it all were historical sites related to slavery and Confederate history, and practice runs to Mother Emanuel. He drove to the 400-year-old Angel Oak on Johns Island, the Museum & Library of Confederate History in Greenville, a graveyard of Confederate soldiers in his hometown, and plantations like Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant. And he spent one evening at the beach on Sullivan's Island, a place that at one point was the largest disembarkation point in the United States for ships carrying enslaved Africans.",84,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"When he was done crisscrossing those dank swamps, those barren fields that once held rice and indigo, he must have felt as accomplished in American history as any naive ninth-grade dropout can feel. He'd downloaded books about the Klan, he'd made lists of other nearby African Methodist Churches, he'd weighed the pros and cons of shooting up a church versus a black cultural festival, and he'd jotted down the name of a white church, with a note that this one was just “to visit.” He'd scribbled down Nazi crosses and Klan runes in his journal. He'd inserted and implanted himself onto the few sites in South Carolina that recognized or incorporated the history of black Americans in the antebellum story of the state. He'd also taken selfies, portraits of himself that logged his travels, which by virtue of the medium also captured his solitude, his intense loneliness.",85,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"That Roof's crime was a metastasization of socially acceptable racism into something more rugged and violent was what for most southerners signaled his outsiderness. He'd killed because he was trash, they said. But in Columbia, during the trial, the gossip about what some said was the real reason had blown around the city like an ugly, chilly storm wind. And it was how some of those who knew the Roof family made sense of the crime.",86,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"They said that a rape had occurred of someone close to Dylann Roof at the hands of a group of black men, and while it had been kept a secret, there was a possibility that Roof had found out and decided to seek payback on the most cowardly terms. This was why he kept saying things like “I had to do it,” and why he told the nine victims, who were predominantly women, that “they were raping our women.”",87,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Folks said, one after another, that they felt compelled to tell me about it because they wanted to rip the cloak of silence away from Dylann. They felt like those families in Charleston needed to know the truth. If the story was true—that someone in Roof's life was sexually assaulted and, because of that, he went into a church and rendered such complete destruction on nine innocent bodies—it was such an old, foundational excuse. It was a kind of twisted mythology birthed long ago in this nation, one that had been leaned on to absolve guilty white men of their crimes on the innocent for centuries.",88,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"As they saw it, this story of a fraudulent “revenge” placed Roof in his proper lineage. He had joined the long line of white men who thought the letting loose of black blood, the finding and maiming of random black lives, could somehow reprieve and rescue a white woman's honor while securing a white man's position. These men, like Roof, weren’t victims, they weren’t knights in an honorable war, they were murderers and mercenaries who were searching for their Tara, and someone to blame and punish for their decline and all of their worldly grievances.",89,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"What the Internet has done is transmogrify the old nature of racism. The argument that the defense presented in court was that the answers to his rage lay in Roof’s unique psychopathology. Roof was found to have a high IQ, but one that was “compromised by a significant discrepancy between his ability to comprehend and to process information and a poor working memory.” The same obsessive-compulsive behavior that led him to take 88 bullets to the church and fastidiously keep only 88 friends because of the symbolism to Hitler possibly drove him to become obsessed with racial violence. Dr. James C. Bellenger, the court-appointed psychiatrist, found that Dylann’s ostensible lack of a social network and the rapidity with which he was radicalized, coupled with his inability to forge any known connections even in the white-supremacist chatrooms he frequented, give credence to the diagnosis of a “schizoid personality disorder, a mixed-substance-abuse disorder, depression by history and a possible autistic spectrum disorder.” Much of the evidence that was sealed from the jury offered proof that Roof is on the autistic spectrum, but many people have these differences, and they do not commit acts of violence or harm anyone. And none of this alters the fact that Dylann Roof is not insane—he was declared competent to stand trial not once but twice—and that was why Roof was allowed to excuse his legal team and handle some of his capital-murder trial himself. Roof was perhaps suffering from undiagnosed mental disorders. He was definitely raised in a hotbed of racism. And maybe he was activated by the rumor of the rape. But it is inarguable that he found the answer to his problems online.",90,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"That Dylann Roof supposedly went down Internet “rabbit holes,” by himself, ""going from one hate group’s false information about blacks to another, absorbing false statistics about black-on-white crime and other race matters,” as Columbia’s newspaper The State put it, was one of the things that surprised Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, which is the part of the center that tracks hate groups. Beirich told the paper that “most white supremacists killers [sic] spend a long time indoctrinating in the ideas. They stew in it. They are members of groups. They talk to people. They go to rallies. Roof doesn’t have any of this.” Beirich later told the Charleston City Paper, “If he's like anything, he's like ISIS people. Young people who look at ISIS Twitter accounts, get sucked into that ideology, and then go join the fight in Syria or commit domestic terrorist attacks. He's actually rather unlike your typical white-supremacist killer. This complete online radicalization over the maybe two and a half years he was in his room is very atypical.” If it was atypical two years ago, it is no longer. To imagine that Roof needed a handler is to underestimate the role that the Internet has played in re-energizing and indoctrinating a young community of white supremacists.",91,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"The white supremacists of today, having been kicked off Twitter, often have Instagram bios that offer an eerie good-bye to their opposition: Good night, left side. And there are thousands of them. Like Roof, and unlike a typical ISIS recruit, they don’t have handlers or any centralized way of becoming hooked. Instead, they are brought into the fold because they have found something that explains their laggard social progress to them and confirms their narrow worldview as fact.",92,2018,

They are armed to the teeth, and almost always, they are painfully undereducated or somewhat educated but extremely socially awkward. That is, until their eyes are opened to the fact that within the world of white supremacy they can find friends. These young white supremacists call this reversal “weaponized autism.” What once alienated them now helps them relate to others, people like Dylann Roof, over a common desire to start a race war.",93,2018,

And they view the transmission of these cues as a kind of trolling of their enemies. It is like the passing of a note behind the teacher’s back. Roof even wore shoes to federal court that were decorated with neo-Nazi codes and Klan runes.

Berger of Politico noticed that Trump would often “promulgate messages with racist cues (some more subtle, some less so), then deny or disavow them, while the white nationalist community dutifully perked up and saw those messages as a call to arms.” Although Trump denied any culpability, months later, he twice retweeted an insult about Jeb Bush from an account called @WhiteGenocideTM. A quick glance at the tweet’s origin revealed to Berger a page “filled with anti-Semitic content and linked to a revisionist biography of Adolf Hitler.” And on Stormfront, the same message board that Roof often frequented, having seen the retweet a member wrote that Trump had “willingly retweeted the name. The name was chosen to raise awareness of our plight. He helped propagate it. We should be grateful.”",96,2018,
Rachel Kaadzi,2017-09-01,A Most American Terrorist- The Making of Dylann Roof,"Dylann Roof, then, was a child both of the white-supremacist Zeitgeist of the Internet and of his larger environment.

A place that still has a bronze statue of Benjamin Tillman standing at its statehouse in Columbia. Tillman was a local politician who condoned “terrorizing the Negroes at the first opportunity by letting them provoke trouble and then having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable…to rescue South Carolina from the rule of the alien, the traitor, and the semi-barbarous negroes.”",100,2018,

During the last election, the group was intensely active and not at all subtle about their mission, with their Yale-educated spokesman, Jared Taylor, making robocalls for Trump. Taylor also promised in an interview with This Alt-Right Life that “if there actually is a Trump presidency, he will attract, at all sorts of levels in his administration, people who do think the way we do....

Rogers has said he was “devastated” to learn that Roof connected to his writings, and he denies ever meeting Roof, going so far as to call it libelous to associate the two of them. He issued these denials because many people assumed that there was a link between them since Rogers also lives in South Carolina.

In 1822, one of the church's founders, Denmark Vesey, a free black man who was married to an enslaved woman, was accused of being the architect of a massive slave revolt. Vesey and his army of enslaved men were purported to have come up with a plan to slaughter all of the slaveholders in Charleston, free the rest of the enslaved people, and then escape to the new black republic of Haiti. Instead, he was betrayed and lynched. To this day in Charleston, he is regarded as a dishonorable man and homegrown terrorist, with much less said about the Charleston businessmen and slave traders who brutalized and murdered millions of enslaved Africans to make the city rich, and ultimately the effete destination that it is now.

Near the gate, a man I hadn't at first seen yelled out to me. “Why are you out there in this rain, staring? Come on in, girl,” he said. In any other situation, I would have declined, but the sickness, both for home and the feeling of coming fever, made me want to go in. I felt vulnerable and alone in a new city. I wanted to be around the familiar, my people, so when the smiling man pointed to the doors, the same doors that had let the murderer in, but also ones that were still flung open to the world, I walked in. “Tonight,” an old woman inside patted my hand and told me, “you are Rachel, but you are also our special Elijah.
