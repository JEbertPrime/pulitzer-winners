# Pulitzer Winners
I wasn't able to find any accessible data files with the text of Pulitzer prize winning stories, so I'm making my own. I haven't quite decided what analysis to do with this yet, but the end goal is to use these articles to find how "Pulitzer winners" write.
## The Data
Each csv file will have the stories stored by paragraph, each with a number ordering them within the article. Each row has fields for date published, author, headline, grafs, graf id, and the year the article won. 
## The Analysis
So far I've just scripted out my basic text analysis in R, which is more or less just the processes detailed [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2018-01-trump-state-of-the-union/). As I get more free time I'll do more complex analysis + graphics. 
## The Future
My to do list: write a bot to automate the collection process (I'm having a small amount of trouble with this, will probably fix by the weekend), figure out if any of my analysis actually means anything.
